"""End-to-end stale-CSRF refresh path under VCR.

This module records and replays the **full three-leg** auth-refresh flow that
``test_auto_refresh.py`` covers only at the httpx-mock layer:

1. **Failing batchexecute** — the client makes a ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` POST with a
   deliberately invalidated CSRF token; Google returns HTTP **400** (not 401).
2. **Homepage GET** — ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` classifies the 400 as an auth
   error via :func:`notebooklm._runtime.helpers.is_auth_error` and awaits
   ``refresh_auth``, which fetches the NotebookLM homepage to re-extract
   ``SNlM0e`` + ``FdrFJe``.
3. **Retried batchexecute** — the same RPC is replayed with the fresh CSRF and
   the server returns a normal 200 ``wrb.fr`` envelope.

Why this complements ``test_auto_refresh.py``
---------------------------------------------
The unit-style test in ``test_auto_refresh.py`` proves the retry-loop wiring
fires by swapping in a fake ``http_client.post`` and a fake refresh callback.
This VCR-backed test exercises the SAME state machine through the REAL httpx
client and the REAL ``refresh_auth`` implementation, using a recorded
homepage HTML so the regex extractor for ``SNlM0e`` / ``FdrFJe`` also runs.
The two layers catch different defect classes (mock-shape drift vs. extractor
drift); keep both.

Recording note
--------------
The client construction (``NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)``) makes its
own homepage GET to mint the initial tokens. That GET is **outside** the
cassette context in record mode so the cassette captures EXACTLY the three
interactions of the refresh path — no auth-bootstrap noise. In replay mode
we substitute synthetic ``AuthTokens`` for the same reason, mirroring the
``mock_auth_for_vcr`` pattern in ``tests/integration/cli_vcr/conftest.py``.
