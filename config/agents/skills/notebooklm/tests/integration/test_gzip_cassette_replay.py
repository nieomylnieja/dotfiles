"""Replay a gzipped cassette through ``stream_post_with_size_cap``.

#769 was a real production bug — every RPC failed with ``Error -3 while
decompressing data: incorrect header check`` — that slipped through the
existing VCR suite because every cassette dropped ``Content-Encoding``
on record (``decode_compressed_response=True`` in
:mod:`tests.vcr_config`). This module is the cassette half of the
follow-up regression coverage for issue #773: a derived cassette under
``tests/cassettes/gzip_coverage/`` carries a gzipped response body
plus ``Content-Encoding: gzip``, replayed through the production
streaming transport. Reverting the
``_STRIP_HEADERS_ON_REBUFFER`` filter in #771 makes this test fail with
``httpx.DecodingError`` on the rebuild step.

A scoped :class:`vcr.VCR` instance with
``decode_compressed_response=False`` is used because vcrpy applies the
decode filter at cassette-LOAD time (not just on record) — see
``vcr.cassette.Cassette._load`` calling ``append`` which runs the
``before_record_response`` chain. The project's ``notebooklm_vcr``
instance leaves that flag on so cassettes stay diff-readable, so this
file pins a no-decode instance scoped to the gzipped cassettes only.
