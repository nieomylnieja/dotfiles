"""Error-path VCR cassettes via the synthetic-error plumbing.

SYNTHETIC error response — validates client exception mapping, not real Google
error shapes. The cassettes in this module carry the canonical synthetic-error
shapes from :mod:`tests.cassette_patterns.build_synthetic_error_response`
(the plumbing landed in PR #638): minimal JSON bodies whose ONLY purpose is
    to drive the client's HTTP-status exception-mapping branches — status code +
    a stub body, NOT Google's actual error response semantics.

Three modes are exercised here:

- ``error_synthetic_429_rate_limit.yaml``  → :class:`RateLimitError` after the
  retry budget is exhausted.
- ``error_synthetic_500_server.yaml``      → :class:`ServerError`   after the
  retry budget is exhausted.
- ``error_synthetic_stale_csrf.yaml``      → triggers ``refresh_auth`` once,
  then the second 400 surfaces as :class:`ClientError` (we replay TWO failing
  POSTs from the cassette to capture the refresh-retry sequence end-to-end;
  the assertion is that the refresh path FIRED, not that it succeeded).

Why we don't validate Google's real error shapes here
-----------------------------------------------------
The cassettes are SYNTHETIC — the bodies and headers are constructed from
``build_synthetic_error_response(mode)``, not captured from a live Google
response. They prove that the client's exception-mapping code raises the right
type for each transport-layer status code, NOT that those status codes are
shaped exactly like what Google emits in production. If you need to validate
a real-world error shape (e.g. a quota-exhaustion 429 with a real
``Retry-After`` header and Google-flavored body), record it live instead.

Recording note (maintainers)
----------------------------
As of Tier-12 PR 12.6, synthetic-error substitution lives in
:class:`notebooklm._middleware.error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`
at the chain layer — well above the ``httpx`` transport. VCR's record
hook patches ``httpcore.AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`` (below
httpx), so the chain short-circuit happens before VCR ever sees the
request: the wrapper bypasses the record hook entirely. As a consequence
these cassettes are hand-written from the canonical synthetic shapes in
``tests/cassette_patterns.py`` rather than captured by running the tests
under ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1``. The replay path is unaffected — VCR
returns the cassette's synthetic response to the client's httpx pipeline
normally, and the exception-mapping branches fire as they would for a
real upstream error.

The ``@pytest.mark.synthetic_error("<mode>")`` marker is intentionally NOT
used here: it would activate the chain middleware during replay too,
short-circuiting VCR and making the cassette decorative. Leaving the env
var unset lets VCR's cassette drive the response, which is the behavior
we want the replay tests to exercise.

See ``docs/development.md`` (section "Synthetic error cassettes") and
``tests/cassette_patterns.py:build_synthetic_error_response`` for the canonical
synthetic shapes these cassettes carry.
