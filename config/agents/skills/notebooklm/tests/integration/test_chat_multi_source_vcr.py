"""Multi-source streaming-chat VCR cassette.

This module records and replays a single ``chat.ask`` call against a
fresh scratch notebook that carries **five text sources**, with all five
source IDs passed explicitly to ``ask``. The point is to lock in the
on-wire shape of the **nested-list source-id encoder** for the chat
endpoint — the audit flagged this path as fragile because the
encoding has two distinct nesting depths (``[[id]]`` per source, then
collected into an outer list) and the per-method test coverage prior
to this cassette only exercised the zero-source and one-source cases via the
default-sources branch (``ask`` calls ``get_source_ids`` itself).

What this guards
----------------
``_chat._build_chat_request`` builds the params with::

    sources_array = nest_source_ids(source_ids, 2)
    params = [sources_array, question, conversation_history, ...]

``nest_source_ids(ids, 2)`` wraps each id with two inner lists, giving
``[[[id1]], [[id2]], [[id3]], [[id4]], [[id5]]]``. A regression that
silently flattens to depth 1 (``[[id1], [id2], ...]``) or depth 3
(``[[[[id1]]], ...]``) would still type-check and still POST, but the
server would return an error or — worse — silently drop sources. The
cassette captures the recorded ``f.req`` body so the unit-level
``test_chat_request_carries_five_source_ids_nested`` assertion has a
real on-wire reference to compare against.

Recording
---------
::

    NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1 uv run pytest \\
        tests/integration/test_chat_multi_source_vcr.py -v -s

The recording flow uses **its own scratch notebook**, NOT the shared
``NOTEBOOKLM_GENERATION_NOTEBOOK_ID``, so parallel cassette-recording
agents don't trip over one another. The scratch notebook and its
sources are deleted at the end of the recording run; only the chat
``ask`` interaction is captured inside the cassette context.

Replay
------
Replay opts into the ``freq`` body matcher on top of the
default ``method/scheme/host/port/path`` matchers. The streaming-chat
endpoint at ``/GenerateFreeFormStreamed`` does not carry ``rpcids``, so without
``freq`` two chat POSTs would be indistinguishable. ``freq`` decodes
``f.req`` and disambiguates by param count + ``notebook_id`` at slot 7,
which is exactly what we need: the cassette's recorded ``notebook_id``
(a now-deleted scratch UUID) is read out of the cassette and passed
back into ``ask`` so the replay matches the recording byte-for-byte at
the matcher's chosen slots.
