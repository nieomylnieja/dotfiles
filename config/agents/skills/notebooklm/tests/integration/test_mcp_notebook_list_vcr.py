"""VCR integration test for the MCP ``notebook_list`` tool.

Drives the MCP tool end-to-end through a REAL :class:`~notebooklm.client.NotebookLMClient`
(not the unit-test mock) with VCR intercepting HTTP, proving the full
``MCP tool -> _app/client -> recorded RPC`` path against an EXISTING cassette.

Cassette reuse (NEVER re-record): this replays the SAME ``notebooks_list.yaml``
cassette the CLI notebook-list VCR test uses
(``tests/integration/cli_vcr/test_notebooks.py::TestListCommand``). The
``notebooklm_vcr`` matcher keys on ``rpcids`` + body-shape (see
``tests/vcr_config.py``), so the MCP code path — which calls
``client.notebooks.list()`` and issues the same ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` (rpcid
``wXbhsf``) batchexecute POST as the CLI — matches the recording without any
re-record. ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD`` is deliberately NOT set.

The MCP server is exercised through FastMCP's in-memory :class:`fastmcp.Client`
against a server whose lifespan binds the real client via the ``client_factory``
seam (the same seam the unit tests use, but pointed at a real
``NotebookLMClient`` instead of a mock).
