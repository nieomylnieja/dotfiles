"""Oversized-question rejection streaming-chat VCR cassette.

Regression guard for discussion #1472. The streaming-chat endpoint rejects an
over-long question (above a ~5.5k-character ceiling) with a ``wrb.fr`` frame
that carries **no answer JSON** (null ``item[2]``) and a bare grpc-style status
at ``item[5]`` — e.g.::

    [["wrb.fr", null, null, null, null, [3]]]   # 3 == INVALID_ARGUMENT
    [["di", 198], ["af.httprm", 197, "...", 6]]
    [["e", 4, null, null, 132]]                  # stream bookkeeping, NOT the error

The pre-fix parser only surfaced ``"er"`` frames and the
``UserDisplayableError`` payload shape, so this bare-status rejection collapsed
into the generic ``ChatResponseParseError`` ("No parseable chunks ..."), masking
the real cause. The ``["e", ...]`` trailer is a batchexecute stream terminator
whose trailing number is a running byte count, not an error code — so the fix
must NOT key off it. ``_chat/wire.py`` now raises a :class:`ChatError`
("rejected by the server (status 3) ...") instead.

This cassette captures one real rejection so the surfacing stays covered in
integration (not just the synthetic unit test in
``tests/unit/test_streaming_chat_wire.py``).

Recording
---------
::

    NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1 uv run pytest \\
        tests/integration/test_chat_oversized_rejection_vcr.py -v -s

A fresh scratch notebook is created/deleted OUTSIDE the cassette context (its
now-deleted UUID is read back from the cassette on replay). No sources are
needed — the size rejection fires before retrieval. The ``ask`` call is expected
to raise ``ChatError`` during recording; the HTTP interaction is still captured
because VCR records at the transport layer, before the parser runs.

Replay
------
Opts into the ``freq`` body matcher (the ``GenerateFreeFormStreamed`` POST has no
``rpcids`` to match on); ``freq`` disambiguates by param count + ``notebook_id``
at slot 7. The recorded notebook id is read out of the cassette and passed back
into ``ask`` so the replayed request matches the recording.
