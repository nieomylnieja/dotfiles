"""VCR-based replay of the artifact poll/rename/wait flow.

This module replaces the previously-skipped e2e test
``tests/e2e/test_artifacts.py::TestArtifactMutations::test_poll_rename_wait``
which had to be marked ``@pytest.mark.skip`` because the live
generate + ``wait_for_completion`` round trip routinely exceeded the 60 s
pytest timeout. The fix is the standard VCR trick: record once at real
wall-clock speed against the live API, then replay the cassette in tests
with ``asyncio.sleep`` monkey-patched to a no-op so the polling loop
completes in milliseconds.

Sleep-mock pattern (reusable for future long-poll tests)
--------------------------------------------------------
``wait_for_completion`` (and any other long-poll loop in
:mod:`notebooklm._artifacts`) interleaves real RPC calls with
``await asyncio.sleep(...)`` for backoff. During replay those sleeps add
nothing (the cassette already encodes the server's progression), so we
patch ``asyncio.sleep`` to an immediate no-op via the ``fast_sleep``
fixture below. The fixture is intentionally narrow — only ``asyncio.sleep``
is replaced; anything else that legitimately needs to wait (e.g. test
setup) is unaffected.

To reuse the pattern in a future test::

    async def test_my_long_poll(fast_sleep):
        async with vcr_client() as client:
            result = await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(...)
        assert result.is_complete

Recording
---------
Recording captures the create + poll + rename chain as one cassette:

1. ``CREATE_ARTIFACT`` (``R7cb6c``) — kicks off flashcard generation.
2. Repeated ``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` (``gArtLc``) — the poll loop, one per
   ``poll_status`` call, walking the artifact from
   ``in_progress`` → ``completed``. The recorded cassette is then
   compressed (in the same recording session) to keep the first few
   PROCESSING responses plus the final COMPLETED response — enough to
   exercise the loop's backoff path without storing every intermediate
   poll the live API emits.
3. ``RENAME_ARTIFACT`` (``rc3d8d``) — exercises the rename leg of the
   original e2e flow.

To re-record::

    export NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1
    export NOTEBOOKLM_GENERATION_NOTEBOOK_ID=bb00c9e3-656c-4fd2-b890-2b71e1cf3814
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_polling_vcr.py::TestPollingReplay::test_poll_rename_wait -v
    uv run python tests/scripts/compress_polling_cassette.py

The recording itself takes real wall-clock time (~30-60 s while the API
finishes generating) — that is the whole point of capturing a real
polling sequence rather than synthesising one. The follow-up compression
step trims the raw poll burst (typically 50-100+ identical PROCESSING
responses) down to a handful — enough to exercise the loop without
bloating the cassette to 5+ MB.

Replay
------
``@notebooklm_vcr.use_cassette`` plus ``fast_sleep`` makes the whole flow
run in <1 second. The default VCR matcher uses ``rpcids`` so the
``CREATE_ARTIFACT`` / ``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` / ``RENAME_ARTIFACT`` interactions
are disambiguated by query string; the repeated ``LIST_ARTIFACTS``
interactions match by play-count order (VCR's default for same-key
requests), which is exactly the sequential consumption the poll loop
performs.
