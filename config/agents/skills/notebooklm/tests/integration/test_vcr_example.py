"""Example tests demonstrating VCR.py integration.

VCR.py records HTTP interactions to YAML "cassettes" for deterministic replay.
This is useful for:
- Testing against real API responses without hitting rate limits
- Running tests offline or without credentials
- Creating regression tests from actual API behavior

Usage:
    # Record mode (requires valid auth):
    NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1 pytest tests/integration/test_vcr_example.py -v

    # Replay mode (default, uses recorded cassettes):
    pytest tests/integration/test_vcr_example.py -v

Note: Cassettes are committed to the repo after security review (see
.gitignore for the policy). Verify sensitive data is scrubbed
(``uv run python tests/scripts/check_cassettes_clean.py``) before
committing a new or re-recorded cassette.

Note: These tests are automatically skipped if cassettes are not available.

# =============================================================================
# Example: How to write a VCR test for real NotebookLM API
# =============================================================================
#
# To create a real VCR test:
#
# 1. Write the test using the actual NotebookLM client:
#
#     @pytest.mark.vcr
#     @notebooklm_vcr.use_cassette('list_notebooks_real.yaml')
#     @pytest.mark.asyncio
#     async def test_list_notebooks_vcr(self):
#         from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient
#         from notebooklm.auth import AuthTokens
#
#         # Load real auth (only needed for recording)
#         auth = await AuthTokens.from_storage()
#
#         async with NotebookLMClient(auth) as client:
#             notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
#
#         assert isinstance(notebooks, list)
#
# 2. Record the cassette:
#     NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1 pytest tests/integration/test_vcr_example.py::test_list_notebooks_vcr -v
#
# 3. Verify the cassette is properly scrubbed:
#     cat tests/cassettes/list_notebooks_real.yaml | grep -E "SID|HSID|SNlM0e"
#     # Should show SCRUBBED values, not real tokens
#
# 4. Future runs will replay from cassette (no auth needed):
#     pytest tests/integration/test_vcr_example.py::test_list_notebooks_vcr -v
#
# =============================================================================
