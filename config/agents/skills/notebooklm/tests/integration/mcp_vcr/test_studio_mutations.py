"""MCP Studio mutating-tool VCR tests.

Full-stack coverage (MCP tool -> ``artifacts.py`` Studio adapter -> real
``NotebookLMClient`` -> VCR-replayed RPC) for every Studio mutating/read op that
was unit-only before #1733: ``studio_retry``, ``studio_rename``, and
``studio_delete`` (both cross-type routes). Replay only — ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD``
is deliberately NOT set here. (The ``generation_prompt`` fold that replaced
``studio_get_prompt`` in #1896 is pinned over VCR by ``test_mcp_studio_list_over_vcr``
in ``test_artifacts.py``.)

Two cassette provenances:

* ``studio_retry`` REUSES a cassette the CLI ``artifact`` VCR suite already
  recorded (``artifacts_retry_failed.yaml``).
* ``studio_rename`` / ``studio_delete`` needed a bespoke recording — their
  merged-list / kind-probe preflight issues ``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS`` (``cFji9``)
  **twice or thrice** + ``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` (``gArtLc``) before the mutation RPC, a
  sequence no CLI cassette holds. The ``mcp_studio_*.yaml`` cassettes were recorded
  against a throwaway scratch notebook by ``tests/scripts/record_mcp_studio_cassettes.py``.

Every tool is invoked with the FULL canonical UUIDs recorded in each cassette so
:func:`resolve_notebook` / :func:`resolve_artifact` take their full-UUID fast path.
For ``studio_delete`` / ``studio_rename`` the id VALUES are load-bearing (not
decorative): the tool resolves the ``item`` over the merged list response, so the
ref must match an id actually recorded there.
