"""MCP research-tool VCR tests (reuse-only).

Full-stack coverage (FastMCP ``Client`` → research tool → ``_app`` →
real ``NotebookLMClient`` → VCR-replayed RPC) for the three research tools:

* ``research_start`` over ``research_start_fast.yaml`` (single
  ``START_FAST_RESEARCH`` ``Ljjv0c`` POST) and ``research_start_deep.yaml``
  (single ``START_DEEP_RESEARCH`` ``QA9ei`` POST). Non-blocking: the tool returns
  the started task, so the assertions pin the ``ResearchStart`` wire shape
  (``poll_task_id`` / ``query`` / ``mode`` — the raw ``task_id`` / ``report_id``
  are dropped as redundant, issue #1909) — no poll-to-completion.
* ``research_status`` over ``research_poll.yaml`` (a single in-flight task →
  ``in_progress``) and ``research_poll_empty.yaml`` (no task → ``no_research``).
  ``research_status`` drives ``_app.research.poll_and_classify`` → one
  ``POLL_RESEARCH`` (``e3bVqc``) POST. (``research_poll.yaml`` also recorded a
  leading ``START_FAST_RESEARCH`` leg; the status tool never starts research, so
  that recorded leg is simply unused on replay — VCR ``record_mode='none'`` does
  not require every interaction to play.)
* ``research_import`` over two cassettes:
  - ``research_import_sources.yaml`` (empty path): the recorded poll returns
    in-flight tasks carrying zero sources, so ``import_sources`` short-circuits on
    its empty-sources guard and issues NO ``IMPORT_RESEARCH`` (``LBwxtb``) RPC —
    covering the poll→empty-import→empty-result wiring and the
    ``{imported: [], sources_found: 0}`` wire shape.
  - ``research_import_sources_populated.yaml`` (import leg, issue #1541): the
    recorded poll returns a COMPLETED task with 10 importable url-bearing sources.
    The tool now imports via the timeout-tolerant
    ``import_sources_with_verification`` (#1920), which snapshots the notebook's
    baseline source list (``GET_NOTEBOOK`` ``rLM1Ne``) before issuing the real
    ``IMPORT_RESEARCH`` (``LBwxtb``) RPC; the tool returns a populated
    ``{imported: [...], sources_found: 10}`` — the actual import RPC and its
    decode, end-to-end. (The ``rLM1Ne`` snapshot leg was spliced in from
    ``research_import_verification.yaml``'s identical ``GET_NOTEBOOK`` recording,
    which the ``freq`` structural matcher accepts; on the no-timeout success path
    the snapshot result is computed but unused.)

Each cassette was recorded against a notebook UUID; the tools are invoked with
that full UUID so the resolver skips its ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` preflight. The
``freq`` body matcher's batchexecute path is structural (leaf values collapse),
so the query / mode / notebook-id leaf values do not need to match the recording.
