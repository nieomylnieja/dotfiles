"""MCP artifact-tool VCR test (reuse-only).

``studio_list`` over ``mind_maps_interactive.yaml`` — the merged Studio-panel
wire shape (``{"notebook_id", "items": [...], "total", "offset", "has_more"}``).
The unified list reads notes AND artifacts, issuing ``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS``
(``cFji9``, notes.list) + ``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` (``gArtLc``) + ``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS``
(``cFji9``, the artifacts.list mind-map facade) — the exact three-RPC sequence that
cassette records.

``studio_download`` over ``artifacts_download_report.yaml`` — the typed
``DownloadResult`` wire shape, end-to-end, with the report file actually written.
This pairing was originally DROPPED because the download path issued
``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` (``gArtLc``) *twice* (the executor listed to select, then
``download_report`` re-listed), which can't replay against a single-``gArtLc``
cassette. #1488 collapsed that to a single list (the executor threads the
already-fetched rows into the download method), so the shape now replays cleanly.

``studio_status`` over ``artifacts_list.yaml`` — the stateless poll path
(``_app.artifacts.poll_artifact`` → ``client.artifacts.poll_status`` → a single
``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` ``gArtLc`` RPC, which scans the listed rows for the polled
task id). Reuses the SAME ``artifacts_list.yaml`` cassette as ``studio_list``:
both consume exactly one ``gArtLc`` interaction, so each is its own
single-interaction test. The polled task id is a real artifact id recorded in
that list (a completed report), so the status resolves to ``completed`` with a
media url rather than ``not_found``.

``studio_generate`` over ``artifacts_generate_report.yaml`` /
``artifacts_generate_quiz.yaml`` — the non-blocking generation path
(``_app.generate.execute_generation`` → ``client.artifacts.generate_*`` →
``CREATE_ARTIFACT`` ``R7cb6c``). The MCP tool sends ``source_ids`` straight
through (its pass-through source resolver), and the recorded ``R7cb6c`` body
carries the notebook's full source-id list. Because the ``freq`` batchexecute
matcher preserves LIST LENGTHS (only leaf VALUES collapse), the request must
carry the same NUMBER of source ids as the recording — so the tool is invoked
with the exact source ids decoded from the cassette's recorded ``R7cb6c`` body
(see :func:`_recorded_generate_source_ids`). An empty ``source_ids`` would send a
zero-length source list and fail the structural match. The recorded leading
``rLM1Ne`` (``GET_NOTEBOOK``) leg is unused here: the tool supplies explicit
source ids, so the client never resolves them via ``get_source_ids``.

The tools are invoked with a full-UUID notebook id so the resolver skips its
``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` preflight.
