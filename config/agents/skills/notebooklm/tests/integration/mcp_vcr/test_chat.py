"""MCP chat-tool VCR test (reuse-only).

``chat_ask`` over ``chat_ask.yaml`` — pins the real-decode → MCP-wire-shape
serialization of a chat answer WITH citations (this recording carries seven
references, so it exercises the citation path).

RPC fan-out (matches the recorded cassette): ``chat_ask`` calls
``client.chat.ask(notebook, question, conversation_id=None)``. With
``source_ids`` defaulting to ``None`` the client fetches the notebook's source
ids (``GET_NOTEBOOK`` → ``rLM1Ne``), POSTs the streamed ask
(``GenerateFreeFormStreamed``), then fetches the new conversation id post-ask
(``GET_LAST_CONVERSATION_ID`` → ``hPTbtc``) — exactly the three RPCs the
cassette recorded. The streamed body's source-id list is rebuilt from the
cassette's own ``rLM1Ne`` response, so it matches the recorded streamed body.

(The sibling ``chat_ask_with_references.yaml`` was tried first but its recorded
``GenerateFreeFormStreamed`` request body does not match a replayed ask — the
streamed-body matcher rejects it — so it does not reuse cleanly. ``chat_ask.yaml``
replays end-to-end AND already carries citations, so it covers the same shape.)

Not covered here (no reusable cassette):

* ``chat_ask`` multi-source / explicit-references variants — ``chat_ask.yaml``
  already exercises the citation path, and the alternative cassettes do not
  reuse: ``chat_ask_with_references.yaml`` fails the streamed-body matcher (see
  above), and ``chat_ask_multi_source.yaml`` records only the trailing
  ``GET_LAST_CONVERSATION_ID`` (``hPTbtc``) leg — it was recorded for the
  *explicit ``source_ids``* path, which the MCP ``chat_ask`` tool does not expose
  (the tool always lets the client resolve sources via ``GET_NOTEBOOK``), so it
  lacks the ``rLM1Ne`` + streamed-ask legs the tool would issue.
``chat_configure`` IS now covered by ``mcp_chat_configure.yaml`` — a cassette
recorded specifically for the MCP integration suite. Its core RPC is
``RENAME_NOTEBOOK`` (``s0tc2d``) carrying the chat-settings param block
(``[notebook_id, [[null×7, chat_settings]]]``), which is structurally distinct
under the ``freq`` matcher from the *rename* param shape the only other
``s0tc2d`` cassettes (``notebooks_rename.yaml`` / ``cli_notebook_rename.yaml``)
record — so a dedicated recording is required.

The notebook is invoked by its recorded full UUID so the resolver skips its
``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` preflight.
