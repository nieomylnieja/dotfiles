"""MCP source-tool VCR tests (reuse-only).

Full-stack coverage (FastMCP ``Client`` → ``source_*`` tool → ``_app`` core →
real :class:`~notebooklm.client.NotebookLMClient` → VCR-replayed RPC) for the
source tools, asserting the exact ``structured_content`` an MCP client receives.

Tools covered and the cassette each replays:

* ``source_list`` over ``sources_list.yaml`` (``GET_NOTEBOOK`` → ``rLM1Ne``).
* ``source_delete`` two-step confirm over ``sources_list.yaml`` (preview) +
  ``sources_delete.yaml`` (``DELETE_SOURCE`` → ``tGMBJ``).
* ``source_add`` ``url`` / ``text`` over ``sources_add_url.yaml`` /
  ``sources_add_text.yaml`` (``ADD_SOURCE`` → ``izAoDd``); ``file`` over
  ``sources_add_file.yaml`` (``ADD_SOURCE_FILE`` → ``o4cbdc`` + upload POSTs);
  ``drive`` over ``sources_add_drive.yaml`` (``ADD_SOURCE`` → ``izAoDd``).
* ``source_rename`` over ``sources_rename.yaml`` (``UPDATE_SOURCE`` → ``b7Wfje``).
* ``source_read`` over ``sources_get_fulltext.yaml`` — consumes BOTH the
  leading ``GET_NOTEBOOK`` (``rLM1Ne``, metadata via ``execute_source_get``) and
  the trailing ``hizoJc`` (``GET_SOURCE``, full text via ``execute_source_fulltext``).
* ``source_wait`` (single + all) over ``sources_wait.yaml`` (= ``sources_list.yaml``
  plus one real ``hizoJc`` ``GET_SOURCE`` interaction) — the poller probes source
  status via the same ``GET_NOTEBOOK`` list, and every recorded source is already
  ``READY`` so it resolves on the first poll; the lone web-page source's body is
  fetched for the #1698 content-sanity check.

Every tool is invoked with a FULL canonical UUID (the cassette's recorded
notebook/source id) so the resolver takes its full-UUID fast path and never adds
an extra ``LIST_*`` RPC the cassette lacks. ``source_add`` mutation bodies and
the ``UPDATE_SOURCE`` rename body have their id leaf UUID-normalized by the
matcher, so the *value* passed is decorative — the recorded response is replayed
regardless and its echoed fields (e.g. the rename echo's recorded id/title) are
what the assertions pin.

    """``source_wait`` (no ``source``) waits for every source in the notebook.

    The all-sources branch lists sources (``GET_NOTEBOOK`` → ``rLM1Ne``) then
    fans out a per-source wait on each id. Every recorded source is already
    ``READY``, so they all resolve on the first poll and the tool returns the
    unified aggregate (``ok`` True, the sources in ``ready``, error buckets
    empty). ``allow_playback_repeats`` lets the per-source polls re-match the
    single recorded ``rLM1Ne`` interaction.

    The lone ``web_page`` source triggers the #1698 content-sanity ``GET_SOURCE``
    (``hizoJc``) fetch (the 7 ``pasted_text`` sources are skipped by the kind gate);
    its ample body yields no ``warning``. ``sources_wait.yaml`` carries that one
    extra interaction. (Web-page-only fetching is pinned by the unit tests.)
