"""Tracer-bullet full-workflow VCR cassette.

End-to-end VCR cassette covering the most common user journey through the
client API: **create-notebook → add-source → ask → generate → download**.
This is the integration-tier regression test for the golden path — if a
refactor breaks any of the five public-API entry points the test exercises,
the cassette replay will surface the regression before it ships.

The five phases captured in the cassette:

1. ``client.notebooks.create`` — fresh scratch notebook for this recording.
2. ``client.sources.add_url`` + ``client.sources.wait_until_ready`` — add a
   URL source and block until it is processed.
3. ``client.chat.ask`` — single chat turn against the new notebook.
4. ``client.artifacts.generate_report`` + ``client.artifacts.wait_for_completion``
   — generate a Briefing Doc and poll until completion.
5. ``client.artifacts.download_report`` — write the markdown to a tempfile
   and assert the bytes were produced.

A final ``client.notebooks.delete`` is also recorded so the cassette captures
the full lifecycle — including teardown — and replay does not leave any
orphan state assertions.

Recording
---------
Pre-condition: ``notebooklm login`` succeeds against the default Chromium
profile. The recorder creates its own scratch notebook so it cannot
collide with parallel agents that may be using the shared
``NOTEBOOKLM_GENERATION_NOTEBOOK_ID`` notebook. The scratch notebook is
deleted as the final recorded RPC.

To re-record this cassette::

    export NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_workflow_tracer_vcr.py -v -s

The ``-s`` flag lets the recorder log progress between phases (useful when
the report-generation poll takes a minute or two).

Replay
------
The default VCR matcher includes ``rpcids``. This cassette also
opts in to the ``freq`` body matcher because the chat-ask phase
hits the streaming endpoint, whose disambiguator lives in the
form-encoded ``f.req`` body rather than the URL query string. ``rpcids``
is a no-op for the streaming endpoint and ``freq`` is a no-op for
batchexecute endpoints, so the two matchers compose cleanly.

Size budget
-----------
The cassette is the regression test for the user journey, not a media
fixture — keep it ≤ 5 MB. If a future re-record blows past the budget
because the report response body has grown, the right fix is usually to
ask a shorter question or pick a smaller report format (e.g. swap
``BRIEFING_DOC`` for a custom prompt that targets a tight word count).
Do NOT skip any of the five phases to shrink the cassette — the full
chain is the test.
