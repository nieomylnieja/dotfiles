"""CLI integration tests for the ``collection`` command group.

These exercise the full CLI -> Client -> RPC path using VCR cassettes, mirroring
``test_label.py`` (the notebook-scoped sibling). They cover the ``collection``
happy paths (``list`` / ``notebooks`` / ``create`` / ``rename`` / ``add`` /
``remove`` / ``delete``).

Collections are **account-level**: every command takes no ``-n/--notebook``
option, and ``resolve_collection_id`` disables full-id passthrough (a
UUID-shaped *name* is not blindly accepted as an id) — unlike notebook refs, a
collection ``<ref>`` argument MUST match a real entry in the recorded
``LIST_LABELS`` response. Every collection ref below is therefore an exact
**name**, not an id: a re-record only needs live collections with the same
names to exist (no id-hunting in ``_fixtures.py`` afterward), and name
resolution is exercised as a side effect (matches ``resolve_collection_id``'s
Pass 2, not just the id/prefix fast path).

Mutation commands (``rename`` / ``add`` / ``remove``) record a REAL state
transition — a different name, a notebook actually absent-then-present or
present-then-absent — rather than an idempotent no-op, and assert on the
resulting values (not just echoed input), so a regression that silently no-ops
the mutation (exactly the class of bug PR #2009 fixed for ``remove_notebooks``)
would fail this test. Each such command therefore also gets its own cassette
per test method (not shared between the human-output and ``--json`` variants,
unlike the read-only commands) and does NOT use
``allow_playback_repeats=True`` — see the RPC fan-out note below for why.

RPC fan-out per command
------------------------
``client.collections`` issues these RPCs (see ``src/notebooklm/_collections.py``
and ``src/notebooklm/rpc/types.py``); every collection RPC reuses the label
method ids with a type-3 discriminator and ``source_path="/"`` (account-level):

* ``list``      -> one ``LIST_LABELS`` (``I3xc3c``).
* ``notebooks`` -> the resolver's ``LIST_LABELS``, then ``execute_collection_notebooks``
  -> one more ``LIST_LABELS`` (``get()``'s internal ``list()``) + one
  ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` (the membership -> Notebook join). Pure read, no state
  transition between the two ``LIST_LABELS`` calls, so this cassette is shared
  between the human-output and ``--json`` test methods with
  ``allow_playback_repeats=True`` like the other read-only commands.
* ``create``    -> ``LIST_LABELS`` (the id-diff snapshot, BEFORE), ``CREATE_LABEL``
  (``agX4Bc``), then a second ``LIST_LABELS`` (the id-diff re-list, AFTER) — unlike
  ``label create``, this does NOT parse the create echo (the create-response shape
  was never captured), so it genuinely needs two *sequential, distinct-content*
  ``LIST_LABELS`` episodes.
* ``rename``    -> the resolver's ``LIST_LABELS``, ``rename()``'s own preflight
  ``LIST_LABELS`` (``get_or_none``, same content as the resolver's — no
  transition yet), ``UPDATE_LABEL``, then a post-write ``LIST_LABELS``
  (``get()``) whose content DOES differ (the new name).
* ``add``       -> the resolver's ``LIST_LABELS`` (pre-add: notebook absent),
  ``_resolve_notebook_ids``'s ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS``, ``UPDATE_LABEL`` (variant
  ``add_notebooks``), then the ADR-0019 re-fetch ``LIST_LABELS``
  (``get_or_none``, post-add: notebook present) — content DOES differ.
* ``remove``    -> same shape as ``add`` but inverted (pre-remove: notebook
  present; post-remove: notebook absent), variant ``remove_notebooks``.
* ``delete``    -> the batch resolver's ``LIST_LABELS`` (once, regardless of ref
  count), then ``DELETE_LABEL`` (``GyzE7e``). Already one throwaway collection
  per test method (delete is destructive), unchanged from read-only cassette
  conventions otherwise.

For ``create`` / ``rename`` / ``add`` / ``remove``, the two ``LIST_LABELS``
calls that must show different content have an IDENTICAL request shape (all
collection RPCs take no notebook-scoping param), so vcrpy's matcher can't tell
them apart by request alone. Omitting ``allow_playback_repeats`` is what makes
this work: vcrpy's default consumes matching recorded episodes in RECORDED
ORDER (first matching request gets the first not-yet-played episode, second
gets the next), so the "before" and "after" episodes are correctly served in
sequence. ``allow_playback_repeats=True`` disables that consumption tracking —
it would always replay the SAME (first) episode, which would either break the
command's own control flow (``create``, which raises if the diff comes up
empty) or silently mask a regression (``add``/``remove``/``rename``, which
would still pass with stale content since post-mutation state is never
actually observed).

Re-record-safe assertions
--------------------------
Per ``tests/integration/cli_vcr/README.md`` the assertions stay in the allowed
vocabulary — Schema (``--json`` envelope shape) and Invariants (id shape /
non-empty name / ``count >= 0``) — plus, for the mutation commands, asserting
the RESULT reflects the real transition recorded (the new name, the added/
removed notebook id present/absent in ``notebook_ids``), which is a value the
test itself controls (the requested new name / notebook id), not an opaque
server-generated one. A re-record against freshly recreated same-named fixture
collections reproduces the same transition and keeps these assertions valid.

Recording (maintainer, with a valid profile)::

    NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1 uv run pytest \\
        tests/integration/cli_vcr/test_collection.py -m vcr

Recording note: several read/mutation cassettes need pre-existing live
collections in a specific starting state (e.g. ``add`` needs its target
collection to start EMPTY so the recorded before/after actually differ, and
``remove`` needs its target to start with the member already present) —
that bootstrap is done via direct ``client.collections``/``client.notebooks``
calls OUTSIDE any cassette context, not by the test methods themselves.
