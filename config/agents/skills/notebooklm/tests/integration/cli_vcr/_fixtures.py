"""Placeholder ids for the ``cli_vcr`` suite (issue #1452).

Why a *flat* placeholder set (and not a recorded-vs-replay registry)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These tests run the real CLI -> Client -> RPC path, but VCR replays HTTP from
``tests/cassettes/*.yaml``. The matcher (``tests/vcr_config.py`` —
``_rpcids_matcher`` + ``_freq_body_matcher``) selects a cassette by the RPC
method id (``rpcids=``) **plus the decoded body *shape***, and **never** by the
notebook/source id in the request. The 105 cassettes were recorded against 15
distinct notebooks; ``mock_context`` injects a single id (``c3f6285f``)
regardless of which notebook a cassette was recorded against, and replay
succeeds anyway (e.g. ``test_artifacts`` replays
``artifacts_list_flashcards.yaml`` — recorded vs ``167481cd`` — while passing
``c3f6285f``).

The practical upshot: **the ids below are decorative placeholders.** Only a
valid id *shape* (a 36-char UUID where the CLI's resolver expects one, so it
short-circuits the ``LIST_NOTEBOOKS`` / ``LIST_SOURCES`` preflight) matters; the
specific value is never matched against the recorded request. That is why there
is no canonical-fixture registry and no cassette-membership guard — they would
police a relationship that does not exist.

The one place a placeholder is load-bearing is the **input-echo** assertion: a
mutation command threads the id the test passed into its own ``--json`` output,
so ``output["notebook_id"] == MUTATION_NOTEBOOK_ID`` holds for *any* cassette
and survives any re-record. ``MUTATION_NOTEBOOK_ID`` is deliberately a value
present in **zero** cassettes, which proves the echo comes from the input.

Keeping the current literal values avoids churn — they are arbitrary, so there
is no reason to change them.

# Unlike PLACEHOLDER_NOTEBOOK_ID/PLACEHOLDER_SOURCE_ID above,
# ``resolve_collection_id`` disables full-id passthrough (a UUID-shaped *name*
# must not be blindly accepted as an id), so a collection ``<ref>`` argument in
# test_collection.py is always an exact NAME literal (e.g. "VCR Test Add"), not
# an id constant here — pinning a real id would break on re-record against a
# different account/collection (a re-record only needs same-named live
# collections to exist, no id-hunting afterward). See test_collection.py's
# module docstring for the full recording-order rationale.
#
# Notebook-ref resolution (`resolve_partial_id_in_items`), by contrast, DOES
# have full-id passthrough, so this one id is a recording-safety choice (a
# real notebook exercises a genuine UPDATE_LABEL mutation) rather than a
# replay requirement.
