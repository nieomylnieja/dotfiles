"""Multi-interaction mind-map chain cassette.

``ArtifactsAPI.generate_mind_map`` is one of the few public-API entry points
that emits **multiple sequential RPCs** in a single call. The flow is:

1. ``GENERATE_MIND_MAP`` (``yyryJe``) — generates the mind-map JSON but does
   not persist it server-side.
2. ``CREATE_NOTE`` (``CYK0Xb``) — creates an empty note row to hold the
   mind-map content.
3. ``UPDATE_NOTE`` (``cYAfTb``) — writes the mind-map JSON and the title
   (derived from the mind-map ``name`` field) into the note row.

A single-RPC cassette per call would not exercise the chain wiring (note-id
plumbed from CREATE_NOTE's response into UPDATE_NOTE's params). This module
records ALL THREE RPCs into one cassette so the integration test replays the
full chain in order — closing the multi-interaction coverage gap.

Recording
---------
Pre-condition: the generation notebook (``NOTEBOOKLM_GENERATION_NOTEBOOK_ID``)
must have at least one ready source attached. A Wikipedia page
("NotebookLM - Wikipedia") was added to ``bb00c9e3-656c-4fd2-b890-2b71e1cf3814``; the
``source_ids`` list passed below is the single source UUID from that page.

To re-record this cassette::

    export NOTEBOOKLM_GENERATION_NOTEBOOK_ID=bb00c9e3-656c-4fd2-b890-2b71e1cf3814
    export NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1
    uv run pytest tests/integration/test_mind_map_chain_vcr.py -v

Replay
------
The default VCR matcher includes ``rpcids`` which deterministically
disambiguates the three batchexecute POSTs by the RPC ID in the URL query
string. No per-cassette ``match_on`` override is needed.

        This guards against two regression classes:

        1. **Chain shortening** — a refactor that drops UPDATE_NOTE (e.g.
           because the caller assumed CREATE_NOTE persists the title) would
           reduce the cassette to two RPCs. The rpcids order check catches
           it before the replay test silently masks the change.
        2. **Cassette drift** — if a future re-record accidentally pins the
           wrong source list (e.g. ``source_ids=None``), the cassette would
           sprout an extra GET_NOTEBOOK interaction. Asserting the exact
           ordered rpcids sequence rejects that shape too.

        The cassette is the source of truth here — we parse it directly
        rather than relying on the replay test's side effects so the
        assertion is independent of the client implementation.
