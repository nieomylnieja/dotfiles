"""Smoke test for the concurrency integration harness.

Demonstrates that:

1. ``ConcurrentMockTransport`` correctly records peak concurrent
   in-flight requests under a 100-way ``asyncio.gather`` fan-out.
2. ``NotebookLMClient`` can be wired with the mock transport via the same
   "replace ``_http_client`` after ``open()``" pattern used in
   ``tests/unit/conftest.py::make_core``.
3. All 100 fan-out RPC calls complete successfully (each returns the
   default empty-list response).

Semaphore opt-out (max_concurrent_rpcs=None)
--------------------------------------------
The RPC fan-out gate added a default ``max_concurrent_rpcs=16`` ceiling on in-flight
RPC POSTs. To preserve the *harness* claim that 100 truly-concurrent
RPCs reach the transport simultaneously (this test's whole point),
the core is constructed with ``max_concurrent_rpcs=None`` here —
*explicitly disabling* the semaphore so the recorded peak reflects the
gather width rather than the production cap. The dedicated
``test_max_concurrent_rpcs.py`` suite covers the semaphore semantics
themselves; this smoke test exists purely to prove the
``ConcurrentMockTransport`` + ``NotebookLMClient`` plumbing fans out the way
fan-out integration tests expect when the cap is intentionally off.

Performance budget
------------------
Wall-clock target: < 2s locally, < 5s in CI. The transport's per-request
delay (50ms default) is the dominant cost; 100 requests serialized
would take 5s, but at 100-way fan-out they overlap and should complete
in ~50–200ms of wall time.
