"""Regression tests for the TOCTOU close + FD-exhaustion guard in add_file.

Pre-fix, ``SourcesAPI.add_file`` opened the source file twice — once
implicitly for validation via ``Path.stat()`` / ``Path.is_file()`` at the top
of the method, and again later inside ``_upload_file_streaming`` via
``open(file_path, "rb")``. Between those two moments, the path could be
swapped (intentionally by a hostile/racy caller, or unintentionally by a
periodic rotator) and the upload would silently stream the *replacement*
file's bytes instead of the validated one.

A second, independent concern: nothing bounded the number of concurrent
``add_file`` calls. A caller fanning out 100 ``add_file`` invocations could
hold 100 file descriptors simultaneously, exhausting the per-process FD
limit (default 1024 on macOS, configurable but rarely > 65535).

Post-fix:

  1. ``add_file`` opens the file ONCE under a ``try``/``with`` block, derives
     the size via ``os.fstat(fd.fileno()).st_size`` (operating on the FD
     itself rather than the path), and passes the live ``file_obj`` through
     to ``_upload_file_streaming``. The path is not re-opened. A test that
     swaps the path between validation and upload-open must observe either:
        - the bytes of the *validated* file in the captured upload body, OR
        - a clear error (FileNotFoundError, ValidationError, OSError) raised
          before the upload completes.
     What it must NOT observe is the bytes of the *replacement* file
     appearing in a successful upload.

  2. ``NotebookLMClient`` accepts ``max_concurrent_uploads: int | None`` (
     default 4) and ``add_file``'s upload section runs under an
     ``asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_uploads)``. The semaphore is
     per-instance and intentionally separate from the RPC-pool sizing
     (``max_concurrent_rpcs`` / ``max_connections``) because uploads use
     their own ``httpx.AsyncClient`` and don't share the RPC pool.

This module asserts both halves:

  * ``test_add_file_holds_validated_fd_across_swap`` — swap the path between
    validation and upload-open; assert the upload streams the *validated*
    content (not the replacement). The check is performed by intercepting
    the captured upload body in the mock transport.

  * ``test_add_file_bounds_concurrent_open_fds`` — fan 100 ``add_file``
    calls out under ``max_concurrent_uploads=4`` and assert the peak number
    of FDs concurrently held by ``add_file`` never exceeds 4. The peak is
    measured by wrapping ``Path.open`` so we count only the opens the fix
    is responsible for, and ignore unrelated FDs (loop pipe, log file,
    etc.) that would otherwise make the assertion flaky across platforms.
