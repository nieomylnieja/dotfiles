"""atomic ``(csrf, sid, cookies)`` snapshot during refresh.

The race this test guards against is a torn read of the auth-headers
triple ``(csrf_token, session_id, cookies)`` while a refresh runs
concurrently with in-flight RPCs. The pre-fix hazard was: a snapshot
that read the four scalar fields off ``self.auth`` without holding any
lock could observe one field from the OLD refresh generation and
another from the NEW generation if any ``await`` slipped into the
mutation prologue, and a URL builder that read
``session_id`` / ``authuser`` / ``account_email`` directly off
``self.auth`` (rather than off a frozen snapshot) could put the body's
CSRF and the URL's ``f.sid`` from different generations on the wire.

The fix — which is what the current code implements (see
``src/notebooklm/_runtime/auth.py::AuthRefreshCoordinator.snapshot`` and
``RpcExecutor.build_url`` in ``src/notebooklm/_rpc_executor.py``, the
canonical homes since PR #4b inlined the Session-level
``_snapshot`` / ``_build_url`` thin wrappers) — introduces a dedicated
``_auth_snapshot_lock`` that:

1. ``AuthRefreshCoordinator.snapshot()`` acquires under ``async with``
   to read all scalars atomically into an :class:`AuthSnapshot`.
2. The refresh-side mutation block in ``client.refresh_auth`` writes
   ``csrf_token`` + ``session_id`` under the same lock — tiny critical
   section, no awaits inside.
3. ``RpcExecutor.build_url()`` consumes the resulting :class:`AuthSnapshot`
   rather than re-reading ``self.auth`` live, so the URL is built from
   the same generation the body was.

This test stresses that contract by spawning 50 RPC tasks AND one
refresh task into a single ``asyncio.gather`` — they all schedule
together and the mock transport's per-handler ``asyncio.sleep(0)``
forces interleaving via the event loop. Each generation is tagged by
writing a monotonic counter into all three positions simultaneously
under the lock, so the assertion is purely "for every captured request,
the three observed generation tags must match".

Test scope (honest framing): this is the *runtime smoke proof* that
the design composes correctly under concurrent load. It does not, on
its own, surface a pre-fix torn read against an unfixed code base —
the original hazard (a URL builder reading ``self.auth`` live instead
of consuming a frozen ``AuthSnapshot``) only materializes if a yield
point slips into the shared transport prologue between snapshot
capture and request build, which is what the AST guards in
``tests/unit/test_concurrency_refresh_race.py`` lock down statically
(``RpcExecutor.build_url`` is now AST-checked to consume the snapshot
rather than read ``self.auth``, and the no-await-before-post invariant
prevents a yield from re-introducing the gap). Together the AST guards
and this runtime check form the regression net for the auth-snapshot
atomicity contract.

    """Fan 50 RPCs truly concurrently with a refresh, assert no torn triple.

        Mechanism:

        - 50 ``rpc_call`` coroutines AND one refresh coroutine are dispatched
          into a single ``asyncio.gather``. They all become ready at the
          same time and the event loop schedules them onto the loop's task
          queue together — there is no "first batch / second batch"
          pre-serialization.
        - The mock transport's handler captures the request and then yields
          via ``asyncio.sleep(0)`` so the refresh task can interleave its
          lock-acquired write block against any RPCs that are mid-
          ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post``. Each captured ``httpx.Request`` already
          has its URL / body / cookie header frozen by the time the handler
          runs (httpx builds the request synchronously before the transport
          sees it), so the captured triple IS what crossed the wire.
        - The refresh task is also dispatched via ``gather`` — same event-
          loop scheduling as the RPCs. It acquires
          ``_auth_snapshot_lock`` and writes csrf/sid/cookies atomically.

        The asserted invariant: for EVERY captured POST, the three
        generation tags extracted from
        ``(body's CSRF, URL's f.sid, Cookie header's SID)`` must agree.

        Scope honestly: this test verifies the *new design works end-to-end
        under concurrent load* — the lock serializes
        ``AuthRefreshCoordinator.snapshot()`` reads with the refresh writes,
        the snapshot consumer in ``RpcExecutor.build_url`` makes URL + body
        share the same generation, and 50 concurrent RPCs
        + 1 refresh produce 50 coherent captured triples. It does NOT, on
        its own, surface the pre-fix torn read against an unfixed code
    base — that requires a yield point between snapshot capture and
    request build (introduced via a future ``await`` slipping into the
    shared transport prologue), which the AST guards
    (``test_kernel_post_terminal_has_no_await_before_post_per_attempt``,
        ``test_build_url_does_not_read_self_auth``,
        ``test_snapshot_acquires_auth_snapshot_lock``) catch statically.
        The three guards together form the regression net; this test is the
        runtime smoke proof that the design composes correctly with real
        concurrent traffic.
