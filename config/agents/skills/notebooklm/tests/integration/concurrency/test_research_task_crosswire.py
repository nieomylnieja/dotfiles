"""``ResearchAPI.poll`` and ``import_sources`` task-id discriminator.

Regression test for the cross-wire bug: when two research tasks are in
flight against the same notebook (e.g. an end-user kicks off a deep-research
task A and a follow-up task B before A completes), the legacy
``ResearchAPI.poll`` API has no way to tell callers *which* task a returned
payload describes — ``poll(notebook_id)`` silently returns the *latest*
task, so a caller that started task A may unknowingly act on results for
task B (the "cross-wire" bug).

The fix adds an OPTIONAL ``task_id`` discriminator to ``poll()`` and a
per-source ``research_task_id`` mismatch guard to ``import_sources()``.
Optional, not required: the signature stays unchanged so single-task callers
keep working. When ``task_id`` is None and a single task is in flight, the only
task is returned silently; when two or more are in flight, the call raises
:class:`AmbiguousResearchTaskError` (v0.8.0, #1363) rather than guessing.

Four scenarios:

A. **Explicit discriminator**: ``poll(nb, task_id="A")`` returns task A
   even when task B is also in flight; ``poll(nb, task_id="B")`` returns
   task B. No warning fires.
B. **Single in-flight, no discriminator**: ``poll(nb)`` returns the only
   task without any deprecation warning (no ambiguity).
C. **Multiple in-flight, no discriminator**: ``poll(nb)`` raises
   :class:`AmbiguousResearchTaskError` (v0.8.0, #1363) instead of silently
   guessing the latest task — the caller must pass an explicit ``task_id``.
D. **import_sources mismatch**: passing ``task_id="A"`` together with a
   source whose ``research_task_id="B"`` raises
   :class:`ResearchTaskMismatchError` instead of silently importing
   under the wrong task.

These tests do not exercise the network — they assert on parsing /
filtering / warning semantics, which is the layer where the cross-wire
bug lives.
