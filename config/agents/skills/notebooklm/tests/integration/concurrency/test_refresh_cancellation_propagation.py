"""shielded shared refresh task survives waiter cancellation.

Regression test for the cancellation-propagation bug at
``AuthRefreshCoordinator.await_refresh`` (reached today through
``MiddlewareChainHost.await_refresh``): prior to the fix, a caller
cancelled via ``asyncio.wait_for(timeout=...)`` while
``await self._refresh_task`` was pending would propagate the
``CancelledError`` into the *shared* refresh task itself, taking down
every other waiter joining the single in-flight refresh.

The fix wraps the await in ``asyncio.shield`` so the
cancelled waiter unwinds locally while the underlying task continues
producing a value for its siblings.

Acceptance criteria:

    Two ``asyncio.gather`` tasks await refresh; cancel one via
    ``wait_for(timeout=0.01)``; assert the other still receives a
    successful refresh result.

The test is the red gate — it must fail on origin/main (unshielded
await cancels the shared task) and pass once the shield is applied.
