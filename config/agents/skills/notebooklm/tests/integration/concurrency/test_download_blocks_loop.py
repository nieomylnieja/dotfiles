"""Regression test for the download paths must not block the event loop.

Audit item #30 (`thread-safety-concurrency-audit.md` §30):

> `_download_urls_batch()` and `_download_url()` call `load_httpx_cookies()`
> (synchronous JSON read) directly from `async def`. `download_report()`
> and `download_mind_map()` call `Path.write_text()` directly on the loop.
> Slow storage / large payloads stall every other concurrent task.

This module pins the post-fix invariant: each blocking sync call site
must execute via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (or an equivalent offload) so a
slow filesystem cannot freeze sibling coroutines for the duration of
the call.

Assertion methodology — thread-id capture
-----------------------------------------

Each test patches the production call site (either the ``to_thread``
target itself or a method called from inside the ``to_thread``
closure) with a recording stub that captures ``threading.get_ident()``.
After the download runs, the test asserts the captured thread id
differs from the loop thread id. If the production wrap
(``await asyncio.to_thread(...)``) is in place, the stub runs on the
default ThreadPoolExecutor and the ids differ. If a regression removes
the wrap, the stub runs on the loop thread and the ids match.

Why not measure scheduler responsiveness directly (heartbeat-gap)
.................................................................

An earlier version of these tests fired a 10 ms heartbeat coroutine
during the download and asserted the max gap between heartbeat ticks
stayed below a threshold. That pattern proved flaky on shared CI:

* macOS 3.14:    ~55 ms green-run jitter (the original tuning point).
* Ubuntu 3.11:   170.8 ms green-run jitter (PR #621 run 25928433246).
* Windows 3.10-14: 170-220 ms typical, 2594 ms outlier on Win 3.11.

A 200 ms regression signal sits inside the 170-220 ms baseline noise
on Linux + Windows runners — no single threshold can discriminate
"offloaded" from "regressed." Widening the stub trades wall time for
the same problem at the next jitter level.

The thread-id check is a *positive* assertion of the property the
heartbeat-gap was inferring. It needs no threshold, no scheduler
timing, and survives every matrix entry uniformly.

    Pre-fix the streaming loop wrapped every 64 KiB chunk in its own

    that adds up to thousands of fresh thread-pool jobs — allocation
    churn and contention on the default executor.

    Post-fix the producer pushes chunks onto a bounded queue drained by
    a single dedicated writer thread. The writer runs on a dedicated
    ``threading.Thread`` (NOT ``asyncio.to_thread``) so it does not tie

    Two layers of evidence:

    1. Patch ``threading.Thread`` with a recorder that counts
       instantiations whose ``target`` is the ``_writer_loop`` closure.
       Exactly one writer thread must be instantiated.

    2. Patch ``builtins.open`` on the temp-file path so the returned
       handle records ``threading.get_ident()`` for every ``write()``
       call. All recorded ids must be identical AND must match the
       writer thread's ``ident``. CodeRabbit nitpick on PR #981: thread
       construction alone doesn't prove every chunk was written on
       that thread; recording the call site closes that gap.

    A regression that goes back to per-chunk ``to_thread(f.write, ...)``
    fails layer 1 (thread count > 1) AND layer 2 (writes happen across

    """A failing writer thread must not deadlock the producer.

    Regression: with a bounded queue, a producer parked in ``q.put``
    on a full queue hangs forever if the writer raises mid-stream
    (the worker thread holding the put only releases when a consumer
    takes, and we are the only consumer). The fix has the writer's
    ``finally`` drain the queue so blocked puts can complete and the
    producer can observe ``writer_task.done()`` on the next iteration.

    Determinism strategy — engineer the race so the queue is GUARANTEED
    full when the writer dies:

    1. Patch ``builtins.open`` so the writer's handle defers the
       OSError until a ``threading.Event`` is set. This holds the
       writer at its first ``fh.write`` indefinitely, letting the
       producer fill the queue.
    2. The producer yields many chunks. Each ``q.put`` succeeds until
       the bounded queue (size 8) is full; the next put parks on a
       worker thread.
    3. From the test we wait until the queue is observed full, then
       set the event. The writer's first write raises OSError; with
       the fix, the writer's ``finally`` drains the queue and the
       parked producer wakes; without the fix, the parked producer
       hangs and ``asyncio.wait_for`` times out.
