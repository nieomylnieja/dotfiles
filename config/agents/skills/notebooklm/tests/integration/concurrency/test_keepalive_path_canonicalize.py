"""Canonicalize keepalive storage path for in-process dedupe.

Regression test for keepalive-path canonicalization: the rotation throttle keys the
in-process dedupe (``_LAST_POKE_ATTEMPT_MONOTONIC`` /
``_POKE_LOCKS_BY_LOOP``) by the raw ``Path`` object stored on
``ClientLifecycle._keepalive_storage_path``. Without canonicalization, two
clients constructed with different syntactic representations of the SAME
underlying file (e.g. a relative path and the absolute path; a
``~``-prefixed path and the expanded one; with or without a symlink
component) hash to distinct dict keys and bypass the dedupe entirely —
duplicate ``RotateCookies`` POSTs.

``auth.py:_fetch_tokens_with_refresh`` already canonicalizes via
``Path(p).expanduser().resolve()`` before keying the refresh
generation/lock. ``NotebookLMClient`` must do the same for the keepalive
path before it reaches ``_get_poke_lock`` / ``_try_claim_rotation`` /
``_rotation_lock_path``.

The public ``storage_path`` argument type (``str | Path | None``) is preserved;
only the internal-derived ``ClientLifecycle._keepalive_storage_path`` is
canonicalized.
