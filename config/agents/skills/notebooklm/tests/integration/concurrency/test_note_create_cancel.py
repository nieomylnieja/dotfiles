"""Regression test for the shield UPDATE_NOTE finalize, cleanup on cancel.

Audit item §28: ``_mind_map.create_note`` issued CREATE_NOTE then UPDATE_NOTE
back-to-back. A cancellation arriving after CREATE_NOTE returned but before
UPDATE_NOTE completed left an empty/orphan note on the server (CREATE_NOTE
persists; UPDATE_NOTE applies the title/content payload that callers expect).

Post-fix:
- UPDATE_NOTE call is wrapped in ``asyncio.shield`` so an outer cancel cannot
  abort an in-flight finalize.
- On ``CancelledError`` raised by the shielded await, a best-effort
  DELETE_NOTE fires via ``asyncio.create_task`` (NOT awaited — re-raise must
  not block on cleanup), then the cancellation re-raises.

Acceptance invariant:
  cancel mid-flight after CREATE_NOTE returns but before UPDATE_NOTE
  completes; assert either
    (a) both succeed (shield wins — UPDATE_NOTE finished within the shielded
        await before the outer cancel arrived), OR
    (b) both effectively undone (UPDATE_NOTE was cancelled and the best-effort
        DELETE_NOTE cleanup ran on the mock transport).
