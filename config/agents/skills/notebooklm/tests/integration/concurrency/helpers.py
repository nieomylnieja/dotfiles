"""Reusable assertion helpers for the concurrency harness.

Three helpers, each scoped to a recurring assertion shape that
appears across the fix tests. Add new helpers here only when
they would be repeated in two or more tests — single-use
assertions stay inline in their test module.

Helpers
-------
``assert_no_concurrent_overlap(events)``
    Given a stream of ``(timestamp, kind)`` events from a section that
    is supposed to be serialized (a lock, a per-resource queue, a
    per-conversation guard), asserts that no two ``enter`` events
    occur without an intervening ``exit``. Used by tests for
    `_refresh_lock`, the conversation-cache lock, the
    per-task polling dedupe leader, etc.

``assert_unique_outputs(make_coro, n_concurrent)``
    Asserts N concurrent invocations of an async callable produce N
    distinct outputs. Used by tests that verify monotonic/unique IDs
    under fan-out (e.g. `next_reqid` regression coverage).

``with_simulated_cancel(coro, delay, *, label=None)``
    Creates a task from ``coro`` and schedules ``task.cancel()`` after
    ``delay`` seconds. Returns the task's result, or the captured
    exception (including ``CancelledError``). Used by tests for
    `asyncio.shield` regressions across the concurrency-hardening work:
    cancel one waiter mid-flight, assert sibling work survives.

Non-helpers
-----------
Module-level fixtures live in ``conftest.py``. ``helpers.py`` exposes
plain functions so per-bug tests can import them explicitly. Tests
that live UNDER ``tests/integration/concurrency/`` use the relative
form (``from .helpers import ...``); tests at other locations should
use whatever import path pytest's rootdir/pythonpath discovery
exposes for their layout.

def assert_no_concurrent_overlap(
    events: Iterable[tuple[float, EventKind]],
) -> None:
    """Replay an enter/exit event stream and assert peak depth == 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    events:
        Iterable of ``(timestamp, kind)`` pairs where ``kind`` is
        ``"enter"`` or ``"exit"``. Events are replayed in input
        order — the timestamps are recorded for the assertion message
        but do not need to be monotonic (the caller is responsible for
        ordering or pre-sorting if needed).

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If at any replay step the inflight count exceeds 1, OR if an
        ``exit`` is observed when the inflight count is already 0
        (caller bug — unmatched exit). The error message identifies
        the offending event by index and timestamp so a failing test
        can point at the offending coroutine in its log capture.

    Notes
    -----
    This helper does not record the events itself — the caller is
    expected to instrument the section under test, typically via a
    list shared across coroutines and protected by the asyncio
    event-loop's single-thread invariant. Example pattern::

    """Run ``make_coro()`` ``n_concurrent`` times via gather, assert distinct.

    Parameters
    ----------
    make_coro:
        Zero-argument callable that returns a fresh coroutine on each
        call. Required to be a callable rather than a coroutine
        because each gather slot needs its own coroutine instance.
    n_concurrent:
        Number of concurrent invocations to fan out. Must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    list[T]
        The collected outputs in completion order. Returned so the
        caller can assert additional shape properties (e.g.
        monotonicity) beyond uniqueness.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If the collected outputs contain any duplicate. Error message
        identifies the duplicate value and the duplicated indices.

        If ``n_concurrent < 1``.

    Notes
    -----
    Outputs must be hashable. For non-hashable outputs (lists, dicts),
    the caller should write a custom assertion rather than try to
    coerce here.

    """Run ``coro`` and cancel it after ``delay`` seconds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coro:
        The awaitable to wrap. Will be scheduled as a task immediately.
    delay:
        Seconds to wait before issuing ``task.cancel()``. Must be
        >= 0. Use a small positive value (50ms-500ms) for most tests.
    label:
        Optional string to embed in the diagnostic log line emitted
        when the cancel fires. Helpful when a test wraps several
        coroutines under cancel and needs to identify which one in
        its log capture.

    Returns
    -------
    T | BaseException
        The task's result if it completed before the cancel fired,
        OR the captured exception (typically ``asyncio.CancelledError``,
        but any exception the coro raises is captured and returned).
        Exceptions are RETURNED, not raised, so the caller can assert
        on the exception type without a ``pytest.raises`` block.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``delay < 0``.

    Notes
    -----
    Returning the exception (rather than raising) is intentional:
    Cancellation tests typically want to assert
    "the leader survived; the canceled follower received
    ``CancelledError``" — returning makes that two assertions, not
    one ``pytest.raises`` block per scenario.

    Footgun: if ``T`` is itself a ``BaseException`` subclass (a
    coroutine that legitimately RETURNS an exception object rather
    than raising), the caller cannot distinguish "coro returned an
    exception value" from "coro raised". Tests that need
    that distinction should write a custom assertion rather than
    rely on ``isinstance(result, BaseException)``.
