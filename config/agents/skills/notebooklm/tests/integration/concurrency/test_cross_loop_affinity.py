"""Regression test for the event-loop affinity guard.

Audit item §14 (`thread-safety-concurrency-audit.md` §14):
Pre-fix, ``NotebookLMClient`` carried asyncio primitives (``_reqid_lock``,
``_refresh_lock``, the underlying ``httpx.AsyncClient``'s connection
pool, and any spawned ``asyncio.Task``s) that are silently bound to
whichever event loop was current when they were constructed or first
awaited. A caller who instantiates a client under ``asyncio.run(...)``
in one thread and then hands it to another thread's loop hits opaque
``RuntimeError: ... is bound to a different event loop`` deep inside
httpx, or — worse — a hang on a never-acquired lock that belongs to
a dead loop.

Post-fix: ``NotebookLMClient.__aenter__()`` calls ``ClientLifecycle.open()``,
which captures ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` on the lifecycle (read via
``core._collaborators.lifecycle.get_bound_loop()``), and
``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`` asserts the running loop matches
via a cheap ``is`` comparison through ``assert_bound_loop``. On mismatch
we raise an actionable ``RuntimeError`` at the call site instead of
letting the failure escalate into the httpx pool or asyncio.Lock internals.

The test exercises the surgical contract:

1. **Cross-loop use raises early** — open the core under one loop, then
   call ``rpc_call`` (which routes through
   ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post``) under a *different* loop
   and assert the loop-affinity ``RuntimeError`` surfaces with the
   documented message. The error must come from G2's guard, not from a
   downstream httpx symptom.
2. **Same-loop use is unaffected** — open + dispatch under one loop and
   confirm 100 fan-out calls succeed (no false positive on the
   ``is`` comparison).
3. **No binding before open()** — a freshly-constructed ``NotebookLMClient``
   that has never entered its context has
   ``core._collaborators.lifecycle.get_bound_loop() is None``.
   ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post``'s loop check is a no-op while
   unbound; the later kernel access raises the existing not-open error, not
   the loop guard.

Why this lives under ``tests/integration/concurrency/`` and not
``tests/unit/``: the regression requires a real ``httpx.AsyncClient``
that has actually been opened, so we reuse the ``ConcurrentMockTransport``
swap-in pattern documented in ``test_harness_smoke.py``. The fix
itself is a one-line ``is`` comparison — but verifying it requires
two distinct event loops, which is integration-shaped.
