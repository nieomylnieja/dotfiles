"""Regression test for the httpx connection-pool tuning via ConnectionLimits.

Audit item #3 (`thread-safety-concurrency-audit.md` §3, also §19):
Pre-fix, runtime configuration used by ``NotebookLMClient.__init__`` /
``from_storage`` did not pass a ``limits=`` kwarg to ``httpx.AsyncClient(...)``,
defaulting to httpx's `~100 / 20-per-host` pool.
Heavy fan-out workloads (FastAPI services sharing a client across many
concurrent requests, large `wait_for_sources` batches) tripped
`httpx.PoolTimeout`.

Post-fix: a stable `ConnectionLimits` dataclass on
`notebooklm.types` exposes pool tuning, defaults to
`max_connections=100, max_keepalive_connections=50,
keepalive_expiry=30.0`, and is plumbed through runtime configuration used by
``NotebookLMClient.__init__`` / ``from_storage``.

The test asserts the limits passed to `httpx.AsyncClient` match the
configured values. A real-pool stress test (200-way fan-out against
a stdlib http.server) is the audit's preferred verification, but the
deterministic constructor-args check is sufficient and avoids the
infrastructure overhead of an in-process server in the test suite.
