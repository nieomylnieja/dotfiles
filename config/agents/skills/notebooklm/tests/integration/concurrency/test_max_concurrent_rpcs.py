"""Regression test for the ``max_concurrent_rpcs`` semaphore at
``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post``.

Pre-fix, ``NotebookLMClient`` exposed no ceiling on simultaneous
in-flight RPC POSTs. A FastAPI handler that fanned out a couple
hundred ``client.notebooks.list()`` calls in parallel would push
all of them through ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`` together, exceeding
the underlying httpx connection-pool budget and tripping
``httpx.PoolTimeout``. The companion connection-pool tuning raised
the default ``max_connections`` to 100, but a default *upstream*
gate is still needed because (1) connection-pool saturation
surfaces as opaque timeouts rather than clear back-pressure, and
(2) batchexecute itself rate-limits heavy fan-out so an explicit
knob lets callers tune for their account tier.

Post-fix: a per-instance ``asyncio.Semaphore`` is acquired at
the top of ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`` and released on every exit path.
Defaults to ``16`` — well below the default ``max_connections=100`` so
there's headroom for short-lived helper requests (refresh GETs, upload
preflights) that aren't gated by the same semaphore.

Architectural decision (locked iter-1):
---------------------------------------

The semaphore is placed at ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`` **only**:

- NOT at ``rpc_call`` — the decode-time retry path recursively calls
  ``RpcExecutor.rpc_call(..., _is_retry=True)``. A semaphore
  there would have the outer call hold one permit while waiting for
  the inner call to release one → deadlock under any cap < 2, and
  permit-fragmentation risk under any cap.
- NOT at ``refresh_auth`` — that path uses a raw ``http_client.get(...)``
  on the homepage URL, not the batchexecute POST pipeline. Wrapping it
  would double-gate the refresh-then-retry waterfall and let one slow
  refresh starve in-flight RPCs.

The semaphore is also lazily constructed (``asyncio.Semaphore()`` binds
to the running loop in older Python versions; ``NotebookLMClient`` can be
constructed outside one). Mirrors the lazy-init pattern used by the reqid and
auth-refresh loop-bound collaborators.

Test scenarios
--------------

1. ``max_concurrent_rpcs=16`` + 100-way fan-out → peak in-flight ≤ 16.
2. ``max_concurrent_rpcs=1`` + 10-way fan-out → fully serialized
   (peak == 1).
3. ``max_concurrent_rpcs=None`` + 50-way fan-out → no cap; peak
   approaches 50 (allowing the usual asyncio-scheduling slack).
4. ``max_concurrent_rpcs > limits.max_connections`` → ``ValueError`` at
   ``NotebookLMClient`` construction (B3 cross-validation guard
   pre-declared in ``ConnectionLimits``'s docstring).
