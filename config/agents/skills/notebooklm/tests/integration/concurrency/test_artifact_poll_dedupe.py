"""leader/follower polling dedupe for ``wait_for_completion``.

Regression test for poll-dedup: when N callers concurrently
invoke ``ArtifactsAPI.wait_for_completion`` for the *same* ``(notebook_id,
task_id)``, each runs its own poll loop and issues N independent
``LIST_ARTIFACTS`` requests per polling tick — wasteful at best and a
rate-limit / quota burner at worst.

The fix wires a per-instance artifact poll registry keyed by
``(notebook_id, task_id)``. The *leader* (first caller) spawns a shielded
poll task; *followers* await the shared future via ``asyncio.shield(future)``.
Cancellation is per-caller — only the
cancelled caller's await raises; the underlying poll continues; remaining
followers still receive the result.

Five scenarios:

A. Dedupe — two concurrent waiters; only ONE poll loop runs; both receive
   the same ``GenerationStatus``.
B. Leader cancellation — cancel the first waiter mid-poll; the second
   waiter still receives a result (poll continues via shielded task).
C. Cleanup on success — after both waiters return, the pending registry
   is empty.
D. Cleanup on exception — poll raises; both waiters see the exception;
   the pending registry is empty.
E. Orphan-exception suppression — leader cancels with no follower
   attached AND the poll subsequently fails. The
   ``_consume_orphan_exception`` callback must retrieve the exception
   from the unawaited future so asyncio does not log
   "Future exception was never retrieved" at GC time.

Implementation strategy: monkey-patch ``ArtifactsAPI.poll_status`` to a
controllable async function so the test owns the poll-loop's progression
deterministically — no httpx mocking, no race-prone sleeps. We assert
on the *number of times* ``poll_status`` was called for the deduped
``(nb, task_id)`` pair: one leader = one logical poll loop = one call
sequence, regardless of how many followers piled on.
