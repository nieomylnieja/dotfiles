"""Regression test for the configurable upload timeouts.

Audit item #20 (`thread-safety-concurrency-audit.md` §20):
Pre-fix, the resumable-upload `_start_resumable_upload` helper and the
finalize POST in `_upload_file_streaming` instantiated
`httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=httpx.Timeout(...))` with hardcoded values
(10.0s connect / 60.0s read for start, 10.0s connect / 300.0s read for
finalize). Callers uploading very large files on slow networks (or
testing with deliberately short timeouts) had no way to override.

Post-fix: `NotebookLMClient.__init__` / `from_storage` accept
`upload_timeout: httpx.Timeout | None = None`, threaded to
`SourcesAPI`, and used at both hardcoded sites. ``None`` (default)
preserves the original hardcoded values for back-compat — defaults
are NOT changed silently.

The test asserts the timeout passed to ``httpx.AsyncClient`` at the
upload sites matches the configured value, and that the default
unchanged when no override is supplied.
