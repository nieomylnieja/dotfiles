"""Regression test for the shield upload finalize + Scotty cancel cleanup.

Audit item §9: pre-fix, a `CancelledError` arriving mid-`_upload_file_streaming`
abandoned the in-flight `"upload, finalize"` POST without waiting for the
server's 200 (or its error). The server-side resumable upload session
either:
  - Completed silently (the server processed all bytes but the client
    never learned), leaving a dangling registered source with no
    title-update applied, OR
  - Remained half-finalized, the resumable URL still alive, holding
    quota until Scotty's GC timeout expired.

Post-fix:
  - The finalize POST is wrapped in ``asyncio.shield`` so a cancel
    mid-POST lets the request complete; the cancel then propagates after
    the response is received (or after the inner Task wins the race).
  - If the cancel arrives BEFORE the finalize POST is dispatched, the
    handler fires a best-effort Scotty cancel
    (``X-Goog-Upload-Command: cancel``) to the same resumable upload URL
    via ``asyncio.create_task`` so the re-raise is never blocked.

This module asserts both branches:

1. ``test_cancel_after_finalize_started_shield_completes_request``
   Holds the mock transport handler until the test releases it. Cancels
   AFTER the handler has started → the shielded inner Task keeps the
   POST in flight, the handler returns 200, and the captured request
   list shows a completed ``"upload, finalize"`` POST.

2. ``test_cancel_before_finalize_fires_scotty_cleanup``
   Blocks ``httpx.AsyncClient.__aenter__`` on an event that the test
   never releases for the finalize client, so the cancel hits BEFORE
   the finalize POST is dispatched. Asserts a separate POST with
   ``X-Goog-Upload-Command: cancel`` lands on the same upload URL.
