"""Regression tests for the `__aexit__` exception arbitration + close-leak repair.

Audit items:
- §25: `NotebookLMClient.__aexit__` lacked try/except, so a `close()` exception
  masked the body's exception (and could leave the transport open).
- §7: `client.close()` did not shield `aclose()`, so a `CancelledError` arriving
  mid-close could leak the underlying httpx client.

Coverage:
1. Body raises + close raises → body exception propagates, close logged at
   WARNING, transport closed.
2. Body succeeds + close raises → close exception propagates.
3. Cancel mid-close → transport still closed.
