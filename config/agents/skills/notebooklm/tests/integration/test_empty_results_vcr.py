"""Empty-result VCR cassettes — parser edge cases for empty state.

Three cassettes exercise the empty-collection code paths in:

* :mod:`notebooklm._sources` — ``SourcesAPI.list`` on a brand-new notebook
  with zero sources must return ``[]``, not ``None`` and not raise.
* :mod:`notebooklm._artifacts` — ``ArtifactsAPI.list`` on a notebook with no
  generated artifacts must return ``[]`` and must not propagate any error
  from the mind-map sidecar.
* :mod:`notebooklm._research` — ``ResearchAPI.poll`` against a notebook that
  has never started research must return the well-formed sentinel dict
  ``{"status": "no_research", "tasks": []}`` (the empty-state contract
  documented on ``poll``'s docstring).

Empty results are a VALID state, not an error condition. Each test asserts
the parser yields an empty collection (the exact empty type the API returns,
NOT ``None`` and NOT an exception) so future drift toward "treat empty as
error" is caught at replay time.

Recording (LIVE):

    NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD=1 uv run pytest \\
        tests/integration/test_empty_results_vcr.py -v -s

Recording creates an ephemeral scratch notebook, runs the three reads
against it, then deletes the notebook. The notebook ID is therefore
incidental to replay — the cassettes are matched by RPC method + body,
not by notebook UUID.
