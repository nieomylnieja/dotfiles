"""Cassette-shape regression lint.

This module walks every VCR cassette under ``tests/cassettes`` and asserts a
small set of structural invariants that the known cassette-shape regression
classes violate. The intent is to catch reintroductions of those defect
classes before they reach ``main``.

Assertions per batchexecute interaction (URL carries ``?rpcids=``):

* **A. rpcids ↔ WRB id alignment.** Every RPC ID named in the URL's ``rpcids``
  query parameter must appear as the second slot of a ``"wrb.fr"`` envelope in
  the chunked response. Surplus URL rpcids (named but never answered) are a
  defect; surplus WRB ids (answered but not requested) are likewise rejected.
  Envelope ids ``"di"``, ``"af.httprm"``, ``"e"`` are housekeeping and ignored.

* **B. f.req decodes.** ``f.req`` extracted from the urlencoded body must
  URL-decode and ``json.loads`` to a list. ``f.req=SCRUBBED`` trips this.

* **C. Chunked byte-counts are accurate.** Each integer prefix in the
  ``)]}'``-stripped response body must equal the UTF-8 byte length of the
  single JSON line that follows it.

* **D. No leaked patterns** (applies to ALL interactions): escaped display-
  name JSON literals like ``\\"Capitalized Two Words\\"``,
  ``lh3.googleusercontent.com/(a|ogw)/`` avatar URLs, and the literal IP
  ``108.5.149.175``.

In addition, for the specific RPC ID ``otS69`` (chat ask) the lint enforces
the new 9-param outer shape ``[null, "<inner-json-string>"]`` whose inner
JSON-decoded list carries at least 9 params.

Cassettes flagged by the audit's "needs re-recording" set are marked xfail
with explicit reasons referencing their follow-up repair work. When the
corresponding follow-up PR lands and re-records the cassette, the xfail
marker MUST be removed in that PR.

Non-batchexecute interactions (e.g. the streaming-query endpoint
``GenerateFreeFormStreamed``, GETs against the SPA shell, the legacy
``example_httpbin_*`` fixtures) skip the RPC-shape assertions because they
do not carry a ``rpcids`` query parameter or WRB envelope. The leak-pattern
check (D) still runs against their YAML text.
