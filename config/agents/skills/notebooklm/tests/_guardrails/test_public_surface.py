"""Enforce the declared ``__all__`` on ``client.py`` and ``auth.py``.

Both modules curate a public surface that the rest of the codebase, the
documented API, and external integrators depend on. ``__all__`` is the
machine-checkable contract:

* ``notebooklm.client`` exports exactly ``NotebookLMClient``. Other names in
  that module are pulled in for typing / re-export reasons but are not part of
  the public surface.

* ``notebooklm.auth`` exports the audited set of names externally imported
  across ``src/``, ``tests/``, ``docs/`` as of 2026-05-17. Underscore-prefixed
  names remain accessible on the module — some tests poke at them as whitebox
  affordances — but are intentionally excluded from ``__all__``.

Two complementary tests guard the contract:

1. The snapshot test (``test_*_module_has_expected_all``) pins the exact
   list, so accidental drift in shape or ordering fails loudly.
2. The audit test (``test_*_all_matches_external_imports_audit``) AST-scans
   ``src/``, ``tests/``, ``docs/`` for direct imports and binding-aware
   first-party ``auth.Name`` uses, then fails if any externally imported public
   name was added without updating ``__all__``.

#
# 23 entries came from PR-1 (#1592). ``KEEP_ACCOUNT`` and ``LoginWriteOutcome`` were
# added when ``__all__`` was pinned to the documented surface: they were blessed
# additively alongside the storage-writer refactor but no caller — first-party or
# test — ever imported them. ``drop_legacy_account_key`` joined here when the
# master-token-relocation PR-0 removed its last two ``src/`` call sites — the CLI
# login writers now rely on ``replace_from_login`` scrubbing the legacy key
# internally instead of calling this facade helper afterward.
# ``exchange_master_token`` / ``mint_cookies`` / ``persist_minted_jar`` /
# ``write_master_token`` / ``generate_android_id`` joined here in PR-2 of the
# same follow-up: the CLI now calls the coarse transaction ops
# (``master_token_bootstrap`` / ``master_token_remint`` / etc., tracked in
# ``AUTH_CROSS_BOUNDARY_NAMES`` above) instead of assembling these primitives
# itself, but they stay importable for the documented low-level recipe
# (docs/python-api.md) and any external caller that already depends on them.
# All entries here are covered rather than in ``AUTH_CROSS_BOUNDARY_NAMES``
# (which requires a live first-party importer).
#
# ``get_account_email_for_storage`` / ``get_authuser_for_storage`` /
# ``clear_account_metadata`` / ``extract_email_from_html`` / ``write_account_metadata``
# are the exception to the "de-blessed from __all__" history above: they were
# never public API, only cross-boundary. Their last cli/_app facade importers
# switched to coarse ops (``resolve_account_identity`` for the first two,
# ``repair_account_metadata_from_playwright_storage`` for the latter three —
# auth cross-boundary ledger shrink, follow-up to #2103), but all five names
# stay frozen on ``notebooklm.auth`` for first-party test callers
# (``tests/_guardrails/test_public_surface_manifest.py``'s
# ``_AUTH_FIRST_PARTY_COMPATIBILITY_NAMES``), so they land here rather than
# disappearing from the facade entirely.
#
# ``read_account_metadata_from_storage_state`` joined the same follow-up for a
# different reason: it is not in ``_AUTH_FIRST_PARTY_COMPATIBILITY_NAMES``, but
# ``scripts/api-compat-allowlist.json`` explicitly records it as a "de-advertisement,
# not removal" that stays importable — dropping the facade alias entirely (as an
# earlier revision of this PR did) silently broke that documented promise with no
# guardrail catching it, since the audit script only diffs ``__all__`` membership.
