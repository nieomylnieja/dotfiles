"""Meta-lint: a module-size ratchet for ``src/notebooklm/``.

ADR-0008 (``docs/adr/0008-cli-services-extraction-pattern.md``) recorded the
missing line-count gate at the time this guard was introduced: the session
command shrink target "lands when the proxy block goes", while the existing
diagnostic (``scripts/audit_test_suite.py``) only printed the top files by line
count. This lint is the enforcement that closes that gap and prevents oversized
modules from re-accreting. It complements #1331 (which tracks three concrete
splits):

1. **No new fat modules.** Any module under ``src/notebooklm/`` that exceeds
   :data:`MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET` lines and is *not* in :data:`ALLOWLISTED_CEILINGS`
   fails the gate. New code must come in under budget or split.

2. **Allowlisted ceilings only ratchet down.** Each currently-oversized module
   is pinned at its *measured* current LOC. If someone grows an allowlisted
   module past its recorded ceiling, the gate fails. If someone *shrinks* one
   below its ceiling, the gate **also** fails — but with a "tighten the ceiling"
   message: the recorded ceiling must be lowered to the new (smaller) count so
   the saved ground can never be re-accreted. The allowlist can only get
   smaller and its ceilings can only get tighter.

   *One sanctioned exception* (``docs/adr/0033-auth-consolidation-policy.md``):
   a **structural consolidation under** ``src/notebooklm/_auth/`` may add its
   merged module at its *measured* LOC — and may raise an existing ``_auth``
   entry when a **later** sanctioned merge lands in the same module — annotated
   ``# sanctioned merge (ADR-0033)`` with the absorbed modules and the PR.
   "Structural consolidation" is narrow and means one of exactly three things:
   the recipient **absorbs a sibling** ``_auth`` **module in full** (the sibling
   is deleted, or reduced to a one-line re-export shim, in the same PR); it takes
   a **relocation that shrinks the donor by what it grows the recipient** — the
   gate only ever sees the recipient, so the annotation must name the donor for
   the reviewer to check; or it is a **template adoption**, where hand-rolled
   logic inside the module converts onto a shared template. That third class has
   **no donor** (the change is intra-module) and is still net-additive in lines,
   because a template call site plus its ``body`` closure header and explicit
   success return cost more than the inline preamble they replace — measured:
   #2152 grew the same code 22 lines while converting three writers. What keeps
   it from becoming "any growth I call a refactor" is that its evidence must be
   machine-checkable: a raise under this class is legitimate **only** when a
   companion ratchet's exception list shrinks in the same commit (for the storage
   writers, ``test_storage_transaction_ratchet._UNCONVERTED``). Inbound code that
   leaves no donor smaller and converts nothing is ordinary growth and is
   forbidden. The
   cap was acting as the module boundary inside ``_auth`` rather than the seams
   (several modules' own docstrings cite this budget as their reason to exist),
   so ADR-0033 scopes the cap to *file size* and lets the seams decide the
   files. Nothing else moves: :data:`MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET` is unchanged and still
   global, un-merged ``_auth`` modules stay under it (``cookies.py`` must not
   silently grow), and each entry is **shrink-locked at its pin** the moment it
   lands — from then on it ratchets down like any other. Entries are pinned at
   *measured* LOC in the PR that lands the merge, never pre-registered at an
   end-state estimate: check 2's slack arm below fails on any ceiling above the
   current count, so ceiling and measurement must agree in the same commit.
   Outside ``_auth/`` there is no exception — split the module.

3. **No stale allowlist entries.** Every allowlisted path must still exist (a
   rename/delete must update the allowlist).

The ceilings below were *measured*, not estimated. To regenerate them (the
``> 1500`` filter must track ``MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET`` below)::

    python -c "from pathlib import Path; src=Path('src/notebooklm'); \
        [print(f\"{len(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8').splitlines()):>6}  {p.relative_to(src).as_posix()}\") \
         for p in sorted(src.rglob('*.py')) \
         if len(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8').splitlines()) > 1500]"

Line counting uses ``str.splitlines()`` to match the diagnostic in
``scripts/audit_test_suite.py`` (``big_files``), so the two never disagree.

Modelled after the AST/path lints in ``tests/_guardrails/`` (e.g.
``test_no_inline_deprecation_warnings.py`` / ``test_no_module_shadowing.py``).

# Any *new* module is forbidden from exceeding this many lines: a round 1500-line
# cap that new work must come in at/under or split before merge. The allowlist
# below is the *complete* set of modules over budget today, so the gate is green
# on main. (Raised from 900 -> 1000 once ``_chat/api.py``, ``_research.py`` and
# ``cli/source_cmd.py`` were trimmed below the round cap.)
#
# Raised 1000 -> 1500 because the headroom left under the old cap had shrunk to
# the point where ordinary feature work tripped it. The concrete case:
# ``cli/session_cmd.py`` sat at 999 on main, and #2192 — a bug fix to
# ``Notebook.is_owner`` that merely rendered a role — pushed it to 1006 and
# failed all 15 test-matrix jobs. It was resolved by extracting the ``use``
# one-row table into ``cli/_session_render.py``, which was a genuine improvement,
# but the gate fired on a module the PR was not about.
#
# NOTE the trigger is 7 lines, not 1: this gate rejects only ``n > budget``, and
# ``test_ratchet_checks_detect_their_offending_shapes`` pins that exactly-at-budget
# passes. A 999-line module absorbs one more line and stays green. An earlier draft
# of this comment claimed a one-line failure; that was wrong (caught in review) and
# is corrected here rather than quietly dropped, because the false version overstated
# the case for weakening the cap by 500 lines.

# Every module currently over budget, pinned at its ratchet ceiling. These are
# the only sanctioned exceedances; the map can only shrink and ceilings can only
# tighten when the ratchet reports slack. Paths are POSIX-relative to
# ``src/notebooklm/``.
#
# DO NOT raise a ceiling to make room for new code in a fat module — split it.
# DO lower a ceiling when a module shrinks (the gate will tell you the value).
#
# The ONE exception (ADR-0033, ``docs/adr/0033-auth-consolidation-policy.md``):
# a deliberate consolidation under ``src/notebooklm/_auth/`` may ADD its merged
# module here — or RAISE its existing entry when a later sanctioned merge lands
# in the same module — at the *measured* LOC of that PR, annotated
# ``# sanctioned merge (ADR-0033)`` naming the absorbed modules and the PR.
# That annotation is what distinguishes a sanctioned merge from ordinary
# growth; an unannotated raise is the thing this comment forbids. After the
# entry lands it is shrink-only like every other, :data:`MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET` is
# unchanged, and un-merged ``_auth`` modules stay under it. No other directory
# has this exception.
#
# The merge PR must be a PURE MOVE: new code, simplifications, and behavior
# changes land in separate commits (ideally separate PRs) so the pin measures
# the merge and not the merge plus growth. Nothing mechanical enforces that —
# this gate compares a count to a number and cannot see WHY lines exist, so a
# ceiling raise is only as trustworthy as the reviewer who read the diff.
# The pin is also EXACT, so it leaves zero headroom: a module that will keep
# growing under a governing plan takes its pin AFTER that growth, or takes the
# growth in the same PR as the pin.

    "exceptions.py": 1575,
    # ``mcp/tools/sources.py`` was allowlisted at 1020 (over the then-1000-line budget
    # after #1871's shared source-policy wiring + the await_upload era). #1890 folded
    # source_add_and_wait + source_upload_bytes BACK into source_add — removing the two
    # tool bodies (and ``_add_source_to_wait_on``) drained it to ~970 LOC, back UNDER the
    # budget, so its exemption is dropped (one-way ratchet). The module is now gated
    # by MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET like any other; keep it there.
    #
    # The four ``_auth`` modules that used to be listed here did NOT lose their ratchet
    # when the budget rose 1000 -> 1500. They moved to :data:`SHRINK_LOCKED_CEILINGS`
    # below, which preserves ADR-0033's shrink-lock guarantee independently of the
    # global budget. This map is only for modules genuinely OVER budget.
}


# ADR-0033 shrink locks that must survive a budget raise.
#
# ADR-0033 requires every sanctioned ``_auth`` consolidation to stay **shrink-locked at
# its measured pin** from the moment it lands. That guarantee was originally carried by
# :data:`ALLOWLISTED_CEILINGS`, which only works while the pin sits above the budget.
# When the budget rose 1000 -> 1500 all four fell under it, and simply dropping them
# would have handed 275-410 lines of unratcheted growth back to modules that were
# deliberately drained — silently repealing ADR-0033 as a side effect of an ADR-0008
# change. (Caught in review on the budget-raise PR; the first draft did exactly that.)
#
# So the lock moved here instead. Same ratchet semantics as ALLOWLISTED_CEILINGS — may
# not grow past the pin, must tighten when it shrinks — but deliberately NOT subject to
# ``test_budget_is_below_every_allowlisted_ceiling``, because these pins are *below* the
# budget by design. That is the whole point: a module can be under the global budget and
# still be forbidden from re-accreting.
#
# DO NOT raise a pin to make room for new code. Split, or take the ADR-0033 sanctioned
# route (which requires the ``# sanctioned merge (ADR-0033)`` annotation naming donor
# and PR). DO lower a pin when a module shrinks — the gate prints the exact value.
#
# The arcs these pins lock in, for context on why they are worth keeping:
#     _auth/storage.py           3102 -> 1089   (ADR-0034 PR4..PR11B, #2172 B3)
#     _auth/browser_capture.py   1251 -> 1225   (ADR-0033 PR4.1, #2172 B3)
#     _auth/psidts_recovery.py   1222 -> 1214   (ADR-0033 load-composition merge)
#     _auth/refresh.py           1184           (ADR-0033 token-route fold)
# The per-module "sanctioned merge" / "RATCHETED DOWN" annotations are preserved in this
# file's git history at the commit that raised the budget.
#
# Note ``_auth/storage.py`` is *also* pinned at 1089 by
# ``tests/_guardrails/test_auth_profile_document_boundary.py``, for a different reason
# (a consumer boundary). Both are deliberate; a shrink there updates both.
