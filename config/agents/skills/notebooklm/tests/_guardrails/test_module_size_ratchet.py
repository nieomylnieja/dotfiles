"""Meta-lint: a module-size ratchet for ``src/notebooklm/``.

ADR-0008 (``docs/adr/0008-cli-services-extraction-pattern.md``) recorded the
missing line-count gate at the time this guard was introduced: the session
command shrink target "lands when the proxy block goes", while the existing
diagnostic (``scripts/audit_test_suite.py``) only printed the top files by line
count. This lint is the enforcement that closes that gap and prevents oversized
modules from re-accreting. It complements #1331 (which tracks three concrete
splits):

1. **No new fat modules.** Any module under ``src/notebooklm/`` that exceeds
   :data:`MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET` lines and is *not* in :data:`ALLOWLISTED_CEILINGS`
   fails the gate. New code must come in under budget or split.

2. **Allowlisted ceilings only ratchet down.** Each currently-oversized module
   is pinned at its *measured* current LOC. If someone grows an allowlisted
   module past its recorded ceiling, the gate fails. If someone *shrinks* one
   below its ceiling, the gate **also** fails — but with a "tighten the ceiling"
   message: the recorded ceiling must be lowered to the new (smaller) count so
   the saved ground can never be re-accreted. The allowlist can only get
   smaller and its ceilings can only get tighter.

3. **No stale allowlist entries.** Every allowlisted path must still exist (a
   rename/delete must update the allowlist).

The ceilings below were *measured*, not estimated. To regenerate them (the
``> 1000`` filter must track ``MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET`` below)::

    python -c "from pathlib import Path; src=Path('src/notebooklm'); \
        [print(f\"{len(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8').splitlines()):>6}  {p.relative_to(src).as_posix()}\") \
         for p in sorted(src.rglob('*.py')) \
         if len(p.read_text(encoding='utf-8').splitlines()) > 1000]"

Line counting uses ``str.splitlines()`` to match the diagnostic in
``scripts/audit_test_suite.py`` (``big_files``), so the two never disagree.

Modelled after the AST/path lints in ``tests/_guardrails/`` (e.g.
``test_no_inline_deprecation_warnings.py`` / ``test_no_module_shadowing.py``).
