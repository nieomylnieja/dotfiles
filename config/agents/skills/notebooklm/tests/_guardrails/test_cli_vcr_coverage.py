"""Guard: every CLI command GROUP has cli_vcr coverage or a reasoned exemption.

The ``cli_vcr`` suite (``tests/integration/cli_vcr/``) is the project's
behaviour net over the full CLI → Client → RPC path. A whole command *group*
landing with no cli_vcr coverage — and no recorded reason — is how the net
silently develops holes. This gate enumerates the top-level command groups of
``notebooklm.notebooklm_cli.cli`` and asserts each one is EITHER:

1. **Covered** — listed in :data:`GROUP_COVERAGE`, mapped to the
   ``tests/integration/cli_vcr/`` test file that exercises it (the file must
   exist), OR
2. **Exempt** — listed in :data:`COVERAGE_EXEMPT` with a one-line reason.

This is group-level, not leaf-command-level: per-command enumeration would be
noisy and unstable. A group is the right granularity — when a group is exercised
at all, the per-command depth is the job of the re-record-safe assertion tiers
(issue #1452), not this gate.

Mapping is **explicit** rather than ``test_<group>*.py`` filename inference,
because the file names do not all match the group (``language`` → ``test_settings.py``,
``note`` → ``test_notes.py``). An explicit ``group → file`` map is honest and
survives a rename better than a glob.

The exempt set is a **shrink-only ratchet** (mirrors
``test_module_size_ratchet.py``): a group may only leave the exempt set by
gaining real coverage — never by being added to dodge the gate. The two
self-draining checks enforce this:

* :func:`test_exempt_groups_have_no_cli_vcr_coverage` fails if an exempt group
  *does* have a ``GROUP_COVERAGE`` entry whose file exists — that group is now
  covered and MUST be removed from :data:`COVERAGE_EXEMPT` (the "newly-covered
  group must be removed" contract).
* :func:`test_every_cli_group_is_classified` fails if a brand-new group appears
  that is in neither map — new groups start gated.

Two exemption *reasons* exist, chosen by REALITY (verified by reading each
command module for a ``NotebookLMClient`` / ``run_client_workflow`` RPC path):

* ``"Phase-3: needs maintainer recording (#1452)"`` — the group hits the RPC API
  but has no cassettes yet; it flips on when a maintainer records (issue #1452
  Phase 3). No group currently carries this reason (``research`` / ``auth`` drained
  out of it once their cassettes were wired up — see ``test_research.py`` /
  ``test_auth.py``); it is kept as a sanctioned reason for any future RPC-path
  group that lands before its cassette does.
* ``"local-only, no RPC path"`` — the group never builds a client (filesystem /
  package-data only), so a VCR cassette would record nothing. These are
  permanent by design.

The gate is GREEN on ``main`` today.

Modelled on the ratchet lints in ``tests/_guardrails/`` (e.g.
``test_module_size_ratchet.py`` / ``test_no_module_shadowing.py``).
