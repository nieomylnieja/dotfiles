"""Run the cassette-cleanliness guard inside ``pytest`` (defense-in-depth).

The strict cassette guard already runs in CI
(``.github/workflows/test.yml``: ``check_cassettes_clean.py --strict
--recursive`` plus a ``--secrets-only`` scan of ``tests/fixtures``), but it is
**not** part of the ``pytest`` suite. A contributor running ``uv run pytest``
locally — the common workflow — would not catch a recorded credential leak
until CI. These tests run the *same script* with the *same arguments* as CI,
so the local ``pytest`` run enforces the identical gate and the two cannot
drift (issue #1292).

The guard is invoked as a **subprocess** (not imported) on purpose:
``check_cassettes_clean.py`` bootstraps ``sys.path`` and imports the
``tests.*`` namespace for its pattern registry; doing that in-process would
register a ``tests`` package in ``sys.modules`` and break sibling tests that
spawn their own in-process pytest runs (e.g. ``test_tier_enforcement_hook``).
A child process keeps that bootstrap fully isolated.

``is_clean()`` is necessary-not-sufficient — it is name/shape-anchored, so a
credential family it doesn't yet know about can pass silently. This guard is
one layer; GitHub secret-scanning remains the backstop (see ADR-0006 and
``tests/cassette_patterns.py``).
