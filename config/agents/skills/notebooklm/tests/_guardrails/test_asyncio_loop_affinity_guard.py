"""Loop-affinity invariant guard for ``asyncio`` synchronisation primitives.

The #1196 class of bug: a lazily-constructed ``asyncio`` primitive
(``Lock`` / ``Semaphore`` / ``Event`` / ``Condition``) is created the first
time it is touched, which binds it to *whatever event loop is running at that
moment*. If the owning client is closed and reopened on a **different** loop,
reusing the stale primitive either raises "bound to a different event loop"
(Python 3.10/3.11) or misparks waiters. The fix that landed in #1196 (and its
siblings) is a uniform loop-affinity protocol on the owning class:

* ``set_bound_loop(loop)`` — ``ClientLifecycle.open()`` captures the running
  loop and propagates it to every collaborator so a cross-loop call can be
  rejected at the call site.
* ``reset_after_open()`` — discards the cached primitive so the next access
  from inside the new loop rebuilds it on that loop.

This lint enumerates **every** ``asyncio`` primitive construction site under
``src/notebooklm/`` (via AST, so docstring mentions don't count) and asserts
that the construction site is *guarded*: either the owning class exposes the
``set_bound_loop`` + ``reset_after_open`` protocol, or the site is on a
documented allowlist with a reason (and, for known follow-up gaps, a
tracking-issue reference).

Without this guard, a sibling primitive added later silently regresses the
#1196 class: nothing fails until a user reopens a client on a fresh loop in
production. The lint fails loudly the moment a new unguarded primitive lands.

Modelled after the AST-based lints in ``tests/_guardrails/`` (e.g.
``test_error_handler_allowlist.py``).
