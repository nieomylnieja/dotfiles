"""Guards: no raw positional RPC indexing in feature code + no raw-payload
ingress above the facade.

Google's ``batchexecute`` responses are positional lists (the project's #1
standing risk -- the shape can move without notice). The sanctioned places to
decode those positional structures are:

* ``src/notebooklm/rpc/`` -- the RPC protocol layer (encoder/decoder/safe_index),
  the home of ``safe_index`` itself; and
* ``src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/`` -- the typed row views (``ArtifactRow`` /
  ``NoteRow`` / ``SourceRow`` / the chat rows) that centralise position
  knowledge behind named properties.

Everywhere else, walking a decoded payload with hand-rolled integer-literal
subscripts re-scatters the position knowledge the adapters exist to contain,
and -- per **ADR-0011** -- routinely *swallows* shape drift to an empty/wrong
value behind ``try/except (IndexError, TypeError)`` instead of raising
``UnknownRPCMethodError`` via ``safe_index``.

The enforcement is **LAYERED** -- different layers get the gate that actually
carries signal for them:

* **BELOW the facade (the feature/decode layer: ``_chat/``, ``_artifact/``,
  ``_source/``, ``_types/``, the ``_*.py`` facade internals, ...).** This is
  where decoded ``batchexecute`` payloads legitimately flow, so positional
  decode must live behind ``rpc/`` + ``_row_adapters/`` + ``safe_index``. Both
  positional-indexing gates apply here: the chained-descent gate and the
  single-level ``name[int]`` ratchet (whose allowlist is the remaining
  burndown).

* **ABOVE the facade (``cli/``, ``_app/``).** These layers must have **ZERO
  raw-payload access** -- they consume typed facade returns only. That
  invariant is enforced by (i) the payload-INGRESS gate
  (:func:`test_no_raw_payload_ingress_above_facade`): the raw-returning facade
  methods are enumerated in :data:`RAW_PAYLOAD_FACADE_METHODS` (a maintained
  denylist -- the public raw returners found by introspection plus the
  ``getattr``-accessed ``_list_for_download`` prefetch seam), and reaching any
  of them from ``cli/`` or ``_app/`` -- via ANY attribute reference (called or
  merely bound) OR a ``getattr`` string-literal -- fails the gate, with one
  documented per-method opaque-passthrough exemption
  (:data:`INGRESS_EXEMPTIONS`); (ii) the chained gate, which stays
  FULL-SCOPE over the whole feature tree; and (iii) the typed facade returns
  themselves (mypy: you cannot subscript a ``Note``). The type-blind
  ``name[int]`` scan carries **no signal** above the facade -- at rescope time
  every one of its hits there was a benign Python idiom (``matches[0]``-style
  sequence reads, string parsing) -- so the single-level gate EXCLUDES those
  packages (:data:`SINGLE_LEVEL_EXCLUDED_PACKAGES`) rather than grandfathering
  20 files of noise.

* **``_auth/``, ``utils.py``, ``_version_check.py``.** Never see
  ``batchexecute`` payloads by construction (they handle cookies / argv /
  constants), so the single-level scan excludes them too
  (:data:`SINGLE_LEVEL_EXCLUDED_PACKAGES` / :data:`SINGLE_LEVEL_EXCLUDED_FILES`);
  the chained gate still covers them.

This module therefore runs **three** AST gates:

1. **Chained descent (issue #1377, FULL-SCOPE).** A ``Subscript`` indexed by an
   integer literal whose *own value* is another integer-literal ``Subscript``
   -- i.e. a two-or-more-deep positional descent like ``x[i][j]``
   (``first[4][3]``, ``result[0][2][4]``, ``cite[0][0]``). This is the most
   fragile "deep descent into an RPC payload" shape, and its :data:`ALLOWLIST`
   is **empty** -- the #1377 burndown migrated every chained offender, so the
   chained gate re-protects the whole feature tree (above AND below the
   facade) with no exceptions.

2. **Single-level descent (issue #1491, narrowed in #1501, rescoped BELOW the
   facade).** A single ``Subscript`` indexed by an integer literal whose
   *value is a bare local* ``Name`` -- the RPC-payload shape ``name[int]``
   (``first[4]`` / ``cite[1]`` / ``passage_data[0]``). That is exactly how
   un-named row-position knowledge of an RPC payload leaks past the chained
   gate, because a decoded ``batchexecute`` list is always bound to a local
   before it is walked. Attribute/call subscripts (``sys.version_info[0]``,
   ``url.split("@", 1)[0]``) are **excluded as structurally-benign** -- they
   are never positional descents into an RPC payload -- so the gate is precise
   and benign indexing need not be grandfathered. The gate works as a
   **ratchet** over the below-facade scope: files that already open-code a
   ``name[int]`` RPC read are *baselined* into
   :data:`SINGLE_LEVEL_ALLOWLIST` (so the gate is green on ``main`` today),
   but a *new* ``name[int]`` read in an in-scope file NOT on that list fails
   the gate. The burndown that drains :data:`SINGLE_LEVEL_ALLOWLIST` is
   tracked by #1501.

3. **Raw-payload ingress (above-facade).** Payloads enter ``cli/`` / ``_app/``
   through the raw-returning facade methods enumerated in
   :data:`RAW_PAYLOAD_FACADE_METHODS`; reaching one of them from those
   packages -- via any attribute reference (called or bound) or a ``getattr``
   string-literal -- fails :func:`test_no_raw_payload_ingress_above_facade`,
   except for the documented per-method opaque-passthrough exemptions
   (:data:`INGRESS_EXEMPTIONS`).

A string/slice subscript (``d["k"]``, ``s[1:]``) is ignored by the positional
gates.

Both allowlists are self-draining: :func:`test_no_stale_allowlist_entries` and
:func:`test_no_stale_single_level_allowlist_entries` fail if an allowlisted file
no longer contains the offending shape, so once a file is migrated it must be
removed from its list (the gate then re-protects it).
