"""Guardrail: no test package dir may shadow/conflict with another module.

In pytest's default `prepend` import mode a packaged test dir becomes importable
under its own basename. If that basename resolves to ANY filesystem location
other than the test dir itself, it shadows that module and breaks
``import <name>`` everywhere. This catches two distinct collisions:

* an out-of-repo installed distribution (e.g. the ``mcp`` SDK in site-packages);
* the project's OWN editable-installed package — a test dir named ``notebooklm``
  would resolve to ``src/notebooklm/__init__.py`` (inside the repo), which the
  old ``"site-packages" in spec.origin`` predicate silently missed.

It also covers namespace packages (``spec.origin is None`` but
``submodule_search_locations`` is populated) and built-in/frozen modules.
