"""Wire-contract guardrail: positional constants and enums vs the real schema.

This client reads ``batchexecute`` responses by hardcoded array index. Nothing on
the wire carries field names, so a wrong index is silent — it yields a plausible
value of the wrong thing, and a unit test written from the same misunderstanding
will happily confirm it.

That is not hypothetical. A 2026-08 audit against the schema recovered from the
official Android app found an inverted ownership flag, transposed generation
options, a swapped status enum, and two constants naming fields that have never
existed — the last of which had *passing* unit tests built around the imaginary
shape.

These checks close that loop by validating our constants against an independent
source of truth:

* **A. Declared mappings hold.** For every entry in ``_wire_contract.MAPPINGS``,
  ``constant == proto_tag - 1``. Entries marked ``known_bad`` are ``xfail`` and
  carry the issue reference; the fixing PR must drop the marker.
* **B. No constant escapes review.** Every ``_*_POS``-style constant in
  ``src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/`` appears in ``MAPPINGS`` or ``UNMAPPED``. A new
  positional read cannot land without someone recording what it points at.
* **C. Enum values agree.** Client enum members match the recovered backend enum,
  and known gaps stay declared.

The reference data lives in ``docs/mobile/schema.proto`` and
``docs/mobile/enums.txt``. Both are recovered artifacts, not guesses — see
``docs/mobile/endpoints.md`` for the recovery method, and
``tests/_guardrails/_wire_schema.py`` for the index↔tag equivalence this relies on.
