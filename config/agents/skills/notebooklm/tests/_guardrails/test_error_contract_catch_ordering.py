"""Guard: ADR-0019 catch ordering — narrow transport re-raise before broad
``RPCError`` wrap-and-raise.

**Invariant (ADR-0019, "Cross-cutting" contract row + retry guidance).** Typed
transport faults always propagate as their own type — ``RateLimitError`` (so
callers can back off via ``retry_after``), ``AuthError`` (re-login),
``ServerError`` (transient retry). Because those three subclass the broad
``RPCError`` (``exceptions.py``), a bare ``except RPCError`` clause that
*wraps* into a domain error (``raise SourceAddError(...) from e``) silently
collapses every one of them into the wrapper, and callers can no longer catch
a rate-limited operation. ADR-0019's retry guidance states the general rule:
handle the *narrow* transport exceptions, "never the broad ``RPCError``", when
the broad clause would change what the caller sees.

The sanctioned pattern is the one ``add_url`` / ``add_drive``
(``src/notebooklm/_source/add.py``) and ``register_file_source``
(``src/notebooklm/_source/upload.py``) use::

    try:
        result = await rpc.rpc_call(...)
    except (AuthError, RateLimitError, ServerError, NetworkError):
        raise                                   # narrow types: UNWRAPPED
    except RPCError as e:
        raise SourceAddError(..., cause=e) from e  # residual broad: wrapped

This was documented, not enforced — and re-accreted exactly as ADR-0019's
"Unwanted" section predicted: ``add_text`` shipped with the bare
``except RPCError`` wrap and swallowed ``RateLimitError``/``AuthError``/
``ServerError`` until this gate's introduction fixed it.

**Detector (deliberately NARROW — this violation class only).** Within a
single ``try``, an ``except`` clause that catches ``RPCError`` *by name*
(alone or in a tuple) and whose body raises a **different** exception class
via a direct constructor call (``raise X(...)``, the wrap-and-raise shape)
must be **preceded** in the same ``try`` by an ``except`` clause that catches
at least :data:`REQUIRED_NARROW_RERAISE` and whose body is a bare ``raise``.
Everything else is deliberately ignored:

* a broad clause that **bare-re-raises** (``_rpc_executor.py``'s
  refresh-and-retry catch ends in ``raise``) or re-raises via a helper
  (``_notebooks.py`` ``_raise_quota_error_if_detected(exc)`` + ``raise``) —
  the caller still sees the original type;
* a broad clause that **swallows and continues** (the ``_artifact/listing.py``
  composite-lister partial-availability catch, the ``_research.py`` baseline
  probes, the ``upload.py`` post-upload rename) — deciding those is ADR-0019
  Rule-3 / Scope territory, explicitly out of this gate's contract;
* re-wrapping **into ``RPCError`` itself** — not a *different* class, the
  caller's ``except RPCError`` still works;
* a clause catching only narrow types — no broad swallow to order around.

Known evasions, accepted to keep the detector precise: binding the wrapper
first (``err = X(...)`` … ``raise err``) and re-raising a pre-built exception
name are not detected, and ``except*`` exception groups (:class:`ast.TryStar`,
PEP 654 — zero uses in ``src/`` today) are deliberately out of scope; if any
of those idioms ever appears in a broad-``RPCError`` handler, widen the
detector rather than adopting the idiom.

**Scope.** ADR-0019 scopes the contract to the feature namespaces
(``notebooks``, ``sources``, ``artifacts``, ``chat``, ``research``, ``notes``,
``mind_maps``, ``sharing``, ``settings``) and everything above them; the
``rpc/`` protocol package — where the ``RPCError`` transport subtree
*originates* and broad handling is the layer's own job — is excluded. Every
other file under ``src/notebooklm/`` is scanned.

:data:`REQUIRED_NARROW_RERAISE` is the minimum: the three ``RPCError``
*subclasses* a broad clause would otherwise swallow. The sibling tuple also
re-raises ``NetworkError``, which does **not** subclass ``RPCError`` (it can
never reach the broad clause) but must propagate for ``idempotent_create``'s
probe contract — the gate tolerates it (and any other extras) in the narrow
clause without requiring it. ``test_required_narrow_set_matches_exception_taxonomy``
pins that derivation against the live exception tree.

The :data:`ALLOWLIST` burndown idiom matches the other guardrails: it is
EMPTY (the one violation, ``add_text``, was fixed in the same change that
introduced this gate) and self-draining — do not add entries to grow the
debt; a new offender means new code that should copy the sibling pattern
above instead.
