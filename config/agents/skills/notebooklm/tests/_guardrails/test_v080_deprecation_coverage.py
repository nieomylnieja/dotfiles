"""Gate: every v0.8.0-breaking change is either runwayed or reason-exempted.

The v0.8.0 program (ADR-0019, umbrella **#1346**) lands a batch of breaking
public-API changes. ADR-0018 (deprecation strategy) says a breaking change
should ship a v0.7.0 *runway* — a ``DeprecationWarning`` or a stderr transition
notice — so callers get a signal *before* the break. But not every break can
warn at the value level (e.g. flipping a return type, or re-raising a refusal
that is currently swallowed): those are *deliberate clean breaks* in the
already-breaking 0.8.0, documented in the ADR + the upgrade guide instead.

The failure mode this gate exists to prevent is a **silent-and-unexplained**
break: a future v0.8.0 change that neither warns today nor records *why* it
cannot. "Enforce, don't document" — a documented transition that nothing checks
re-accretes the moment someone adds the next break without a runway.

This is a registry lint in the self-draining-allowlist idiom already used across
``tests/_guardrails/`` (``test_no_raw_positional_rpc_indexing.py``,
``test_module_size_ratchet.py``, ``tests/unit/test_public_api_contract.py``'s
``GET_OPTIONAL_EXEMPTIONS``). :data:`V080_BREAKING_CHANGES` declares every
tracked v0.8.0 break, each tagged with **exactly one** of:

* ``runway=<Runway>`` — a v0.7.0 signal that the gate *verifies actually exists*
  (the named warn helper is imported/called in the cited module, or the notice
  substring is present in the cited module). A claimed runway that isn't there
  fails the gate, so the table can't lie about coverage.
* ``exemption=<reason>`` — a reason-tagged justification that the break cannot
  or should not warn at the value level. This set is meant to **shrink** as
  runways are added; it must never silently grow.

The v0.8.0 program has now shipped, so :data:`V080_BREAKING_CHANGES` is drained
to ``()`` (#1365) and the bidirectional release gate
(``test_v080_release_gate.py``) requires it to STAY empty at/after the 0.8.0
bump. The detector and its self-checks remain live so the gate keeps biting for
the NEXT breaking-change program that re-populates the registry: a re-added break
must again carry exactly one of {runway, exemption}, and a claimed-but-absent
runway is still caught.

Self-tests below prove the detector is not a no-op (a planted silent entry is
caught; a claimed-but-absent runway is caught) and that the table stays honest
(no entry has both/neither tag; every cited module exists; every exemption
carries a non-empty reason).
