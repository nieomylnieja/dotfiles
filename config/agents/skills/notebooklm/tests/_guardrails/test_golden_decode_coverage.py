"""Guard: every cassette-backed RPC family is golden-decode-covered or exempt.

The VCR cassette matcher (``tests/vcr_config.py``) compares request **shape**,
never response leaves, so a decode regression that puts a wrong value in the
right slot replays green. The compensating control is the *golden decoded-row*
suite (``tests/integration/test_golden_decoded_vcr.py`` and
``test_golden_decoded_vcr_expansion.py``): for each recorded RPC family it pins
decoded dataclass field values, so positional-decode drift fails loudly.

This gate keeps that compensating control complete as the cassette corpus
grows. It enumerates every ``rpcids`` value recorded under ``tests/cassettes/``
(recursively — ``examples/`` fixtures are illustrative, not replayed) and
asserts each one is EITHER:

1. **Covered** — listed in :data:`GOLDEN_COVERAGE`, keyed by the
   :class:`~notebooklm.rpc.RPCMethod` constant and mapped to one or more test
   pointers ``(file, qualified test name)``. Each pointer is verified by AST:
   the function must exist at that exact ``Class::name`` location, and at
   least one cassette named in its ``use_cassette`` decorators must really
   record this rpcid — so a pointer can't silently rot into a comment, a
   same-named sibling test, or a test that replays an unrelated cassette, OR
2. **Exempt** — listed in :data:`GOLDEN_EXEMPT` with one of the sanctioned
   reasons, chosen by READING the client decode path: either the client
   discards the RPC's response outright, or the method's success contract is
   ``None`` so there is no decoded payload to pin.

Keying by ``RPCMethod`` (not by obfuscated string literals) keeps
``rpc/types.py`` the single source of truth: when Google rotates an ID and the
cassettes are re-recorded, this gate follows automatically. A cassette
recording an rpcid that no current ``RPCMethod`` knows fails loudly — that is
either a stale cassette or an un-modelled RPC, both worth a human look.

Granularity (a deliberate scoping decision): the gate is **family-level** —
one rpcid is satisfied by at least one golden pointer per entry. Where a
family has multiple recorded response *shapes* today (web vs drive freshness,
text vs url add, notes vs mind-map rows), each shape gets its own pointer in
:data:`GOLDEN_COVERAGE`, and all pointers are verified. But a *future* cassette
recording an already-covered rpcid with a brand-new shape does not, by itself,
force a new golden test — per-shape assertion depth is the golden modules' job
(and the review's), not this gate's. The gate guarantees no family is ever
fully un-pinned.

New cassettes start gated: recording a new RPC family without classifying it
here fails :func:`test_every_cassette_rpcid_is_classified` with instructions.

Modelled on the covered-or-exempt gate in
``tests/_guardrails/test_cli_vcr_coverage.py``.
