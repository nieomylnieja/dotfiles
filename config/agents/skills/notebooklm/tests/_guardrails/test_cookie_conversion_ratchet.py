"""Shrink-only ratchet on the scattered cookie-conversion free functions.

ADR-0031 Stage 1. A cookie has lived in six shapes in this layer, with the
conversions between them as free functions any module could reach for. That is
what let "which cookies are here / is this set usable" get re-derived
independently at a dozen call sites, and it is why the auth layer resisted the
#2139 boundary moves: the coupling had no owner.

:class:`notebooklm._auth.cookie_types.CookieJar` is now that owner. This gate
does **not** force a migration — per this repo's ratchet convention, existing
call sites migrate opportunistically, not in an eager burndown. It blocks the
*next* one: new code converts through ``CookieJar`` instead of adding a
thirteenth bespoke call.

Sanctioned homes (never flagged):

* ``_auth/cookies.py`` — where these functions are defined and compose.
* ``_auth/cookie_types.py`` — the value owner, which now reaches only downward
  to pure semantics and policy rather than back up through these adapters.

Everything else is in :data:`_GRANDFATHERED`, which pins each surviving call
site at its **measured call count** and is **shrink-only** in both directions:
a count may never rise (``test_no_new_bespoke_cookie_conversions``), and one
that no longer matches reality must be lowered or deleted
(``test_grandfathered_entries_are_all_live``). Counting, rather than merely
listing the pairs, is what stops a module already on the list from growing a
second bespoke call for free.

    """Map local binding -> ratcheted function, for both rebinding idioms.

    Either spelling puts a non-ratcheted name on the call node, so a scan that
    only matched literal names would have a real bypass rather than a
    theoretical one — both idioms are live in this package:

    * ``from … import f as g`` — ``_auth/storage.py`` imports
      ``_atomic_write_json_unchecked as _write_state_unchecked``.
    * ``g = mod.f`` — the compat re-export surface in ``auth.py`` rebinds ALL
      FOUR ratcheted names this way, and ``_auth/refresh.py`` rebinds
      ``flatten_cookie_map``. Neither module calls its rebind today, but the
      bindings sit in the module where such a call is most plausible.

    Resolved back to the canonical name so ``_GRANDFATHERED`` stays keyed on the
    real function regardless of what a caller called it. The re-export
    statements themselves are ``ast.Assign``, not ``ast.Call``, so recognizing
    them here does not make them count as call sites.

    **Assignments are honored only at module level, deliberately.** ``ast.walk``
    flattens every scope into one view, so a function-local ``alias = mod.f``
    would otherwise resolve an unrelated ``alias(...)`` in a *different*
    function as a conversion — a binding Python never shared. The accepted cost
    is a narrow false negative: a function-local rebind is no longer caught.
    That trade is the right way round for a block-new-debt ratchet. A missed
    obscure local alias costs one uncaught call; reding on unrelated code costs
    the gate its credibility and teaches people to route around it. Every real
    binding in this repo today (``auth.py`` 126-131, ``_auth/refresh.py`` 59) is
    module level.

    Resolution is also one hop only: ``g = mod.f`` binds, but a chain through
    it (``h = g``) does not, since ``g`` is not itself a ratcheted name. Both
    idioms present in this repo are one hop, so that is where the gate stops.
