"""Guard that both personal app hosts live only in ``_env.py``.

Two independent notions of "which host is the app?" that disagree is exactly the
shape that produced #2019: a valid session was reported as expired because one
code path's idea of the app host did not match reality. #2038 gave the
post-rebrand host a single home; #2067 made it the *default* and gave the
pre-rebrand host one too (:data:`~notebooklm._env.PERSONAL_LEGACY_HOST`).

This lint keeps it that way: no module under ``src/notebooklm/`` may hardcode
either host in executable code. Import the constant from ``_env`` instead, so
the next move is one line rather than a grep.

**Why both hosts, now.** Until #2067 this lint policed only the rebrand host,
on the reasoning that the legacy host appeared in "dozens of legitimate places"
(cookie-domain tables, URL builders) and policing it would be an eager burndown.
That is no longer true: the flip folded the last of those onto constants, and
`_code_string_constants` measures **zero** bare literals for either host. Adding
the second host therefore costs nothing today -- no allowlist, no burndown --
while closing the asymmetry that would otherwise let the *now-non-default* host
be re-copied freely, which is the precise mistake #2019 was made of.

Scope stays narrow -- **only real code**. Docstrings and bare string
expressions are skipped: prose that *mentions* a host is documentation, not a
second source of truth. Test modules are out of scope on purpose; a test that
spells a host literally is asserting against a concrete value, which is the
point of the test.

**Passive ratchet, not a burndown.** ``KNOWN_BARE_LITERALS`` allowlists sites that
predate the constant. Entries should be deleted, never added -- adding one means
a new copy of a domain fact was introduced, which is the thing this lint exists
to prevent.

Both host values are read from ``_env.py`` via AST so this lint cannot drift
from the source of truth and pulls in no import side effects.
