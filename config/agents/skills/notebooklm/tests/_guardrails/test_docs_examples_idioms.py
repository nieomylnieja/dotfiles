"""Guardrail tests for copy-paste documentation idioms.

The README and the runnable ``examples/*.py`` are the snippets users copy
first. They must demonstrate the *canonical* client idiom, not a deprecated one
that warns at runtime.

When this test fails, fix the doc/example (drop the ``await`` before
``NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)``), not the test.

See ``docs/deprecations.md`` — awaiting ``from_storage(...)`` emits a
``DeprecationWarning`` (removed in v1.0); the canonical form is
``async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:``.
