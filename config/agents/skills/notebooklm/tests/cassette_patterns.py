"""Canonical registry of cassette-mutating utilities.

This module is the single source of truth for what counts as sensitive in a
recorded HTTP cassette and for cassette-byte-count surgery. It exports two
complementary halves:

1. **Sanitization registry.** A canonical
   list of regex (pattern, replacement) pairs covering Google session
   cookies, ``__Secure-*`` / ``__Host-*`` cookies, WIZ_global_data token
   fields, email addresses, and Playwright ``storage_state`` cookie objects;
   a single ``scrub_string`` entry point that applies them; and an
   ``is_clean`` validator that judges cookie-value cleanliness via exact-
   match membership in ``SCRUB_PLACEHOLDERS`` (closing a previous
   "starts with S" character-class hole). Before this consolidation the
   same patterns lived as an inline ``SENSITIVE_PATTERNS`` list in
   :mod:`tests.vcr_config` and were duplicated piecemeal in the former
   ``tests/check_cassettes_clean.sh`` shell guard — that drift risk is what motivated
   the consolidation.

2. **Chunked-response byte-count re-derivation.** The
   :func:`recompute_chunk_prefix` helper walks an XSSI-framed batchexecute
   body and rewrites every digit-only ``<count>`` header to match the actual
   byte-length of the immediately-following payload line. After scrubbing
   replaces a 21-char user ID with the 17-char ``SCRUBBED_USER_ID``
   placeholder the advertised count no longer matches the payload, so this
   helper runs as a second pass inside :func:`tests.vcr_config.scrub_response`
   to keep cassettes self-consistent and avoid tripping the decoder's
   byte-count-mismatch DEBUG log during replay.

Why both halves live here, not split into two modules:

- ``vcr_config.py`` is loaded for every VCR-decorated test, but its public
  surface is intentionally narrow (the VCR object + matchers). Scrub-time
  string surgery is a separate concern and benefits from being importable
  on its own (the bulk re-scrub script in ``scripts/`` imports both
  ``scrub_string`` AND ``recompute_chunk_prefix`` directly).
- Decoder tolerance behavior in ``src/notebooklm/rpc/decoder.py`` (still
  parses the JSON on byte-count mismatch, now logging at DEBUG rather
  than WARNING — see #669) is what makes the recompute pass optional for
  correctness; these helpers exist so cassettes stay self-consistent for
  shape-lint and don't add log noise during replay, not to harden the
  decoder against drift in production responses.

- :func:`recompute_chunk_prefix`  XSSI byte-count re-derivation

Necessary-not-sufficient boundary (issue #1382)
-----------------------------------------------
The name-anchored / known-shape detectors below are NECESSARY but not
SUFFICIENT: a novel credential prefix, or a known secret in an un-targeted
field, passes them silently (this has bitten the guard twice — ``LSID`` and
``JrWMbf``). :func:`find_high_entropy_leaks` is the deliberate field-agnostic
complement that catches a long high-entropy base64/hex token in ANY quoted
JSON scalar. See its KNOWN-SHAPE BOUNDARY block for the residual-risk decision
this draws (it is scoped to quoted scalars on purpose; non-quoted high-entropy
text remains GitHub-secret-scanning's job). Relates to ADR-0006.

Upload + Drive token coverage
-----------------------------
The registry below extends the canonical cookie/CSRF/email coverage with
scrubbers for Google's resumable-upload and Drive integration paths:

* ``X-GUploader-UploadID`` response headers leak per-upload session tokens.
* ``upload_id=...`` query parameters echo the same token into request URLs.
* ``AONS...`` strings are Drive ACL/permission tokens emitted with file
  metadata. The 20-char tail threshold avoids matching incidental
  ``AONS`` mentions in code or docs.
* Drive file IDs (33-44 char ``[A-Za-z0-9_-]`` strings) appear inside
  ``"file_id": "..."`` JSON keys and ``/drive/v3/files/<id>`` URLs. The
  pattern is intentionally context-anchored so that bare 36-char UUIDs
  (artifact IDs, source IDs, conversation IDs) are NOT scrubbed — those
  are NotebookLM-internal identifiers and matching them would corrupt
  cassette replay.

Display-name + avatar coverage
------------------------------
The registry below also covers two display/identity leak shapes that the
core structured scrubbers miss because the data is double-encoded inside a
WRB-payload JSON string:

* **Escaped JSON display-name literals.** Google's sharing RPCs emit owner
  metadata as positional list elements inside a stringified WRB payload —
  the display name surfaces as ``\\"First Last\\"`` rather than a
  structured ``"displayName": "..."`` key. The core structured patterns
  key-anchor on the outer JSON key, so they never fire on the inner
  double-encoded form. The display-name pattern anchors on the
  escape-quote shape ``\\"...\\"`` and carries an explicit false-positive
  allowlist (font families, UI titles, artifact/notebook names produced
  by the test corpus) so that legitimate two-Capitalized-word fixture
  content is preserved. This false-positive list is the load-bearing
  safety net — a broad
  ``>[A-Z][a-z]+\\s[A-Z][a-z]+<`` regex without it would corrupt source-
  rename and artifact-list cassettes during replay.
* **lh3.googleusercontent.com avatar URLs.** Both the ``/a/`` and ``/ogw/``
  path forms carry per-user avatar tokens. The pattern collapses the whole
  URL (host + path + token, including any trailing ``=s512``-style sizing
  suffix) to ``SCRUBBED_AVATAR_URL``.

Google API-key coverage
-----------------------
The NotebookLM web page embeds a Google API key in ``WIZ_global_data``. It
surfaces across several field names (``B8SWKb``, ``VqImj``, and ``JrWMbf``);
each is scrubbed by a name-anchored pattern. ``JrWMbf`` was originally missing,
so its value round-tripped unscrubbed into the interactive mind-map cassettes —
the API-key analog of the ``LSID`` cookie leak. To close that class of gap for
good, the registry also carries a field-name-agnostic catch-all
(:data:`_GOOGLE_API_KEY_PATTERN`) that collapses the canonical ``AIza`` +
35-char Google API-key shape to ``SCRUBBED_API_KEY`` wherever it appears, with a
matching ``is_clean`` detector so any unredacted key is flagged regardless of
which field carried it.

# don't need explicit ``\A`` / ``\Z`` (claude-bot review on PR #554).
_CHUNK_HEADER_RE = re.compile(r"\d+")


def recompute_chunk_prefix(body: str) -> str:
    """Re-derive ``<count>`` prefixes in a chunked response body.

    Google's batchexecute responses are framed as alternating header/payload
    lines, optionally preceded by the XSSI ``)]}'\\n\\n`` prefix. After
    scrubbing replaces strings of unequal length (e.g. a 21-char user ID with
    the 17-char ``SCRUBBED_USER_ID`` placeholder), the advertised byte-count no
    longer matches the actual payload length, which causes:

    1. ``tests/_guardrails/test_cassette_shapes.py`` byte-count assertion failures.
    2. ``decoder.py`` to emit ``Chunk at line N declares X bytes but payload is
       Y bytes`` DEBUG logs during replay (the JSON is still parsed — see
       ``notebooklm.rpc.decoder.parse_chunked_response`` — but well-formed cassettes
       shouldn't trip the log at all).

    This helper walks the body, identifies every digit-only "header" line that
    is immediately followed by a non-header line, and replaces the header with
    the correct count for that payload. Byte count uses ``len(payload.encode(
    "utf-8"))`` — matching the ``len(json_str.encode("utf-8"))`` calculation
    the decoder uses (which is what the cassette shape lint validates, even
    though Google's live framing appears to use a different unit; see the
    Note: block on :func:`notebooklm.rpc.decoder.parse_chunked_response`).
    For ASCII-only payloads (the common case for batchexecute JSON), this is
    identical to ``len(payload)``, so the shape-lint character-length
    assertion in ``test_cassette_shapes.py`` still passes.

    Idempotent: running the helper on a body whose counts already match yields
    an identical string (no spurious whitespace changes). Conservative: if the
    body doesn't look like a chunked response (no digit-only header lines), it
    is returned unchanged.

    Args:
        body: The response body as a Python ``str``. May or may not be prefixed
            with the XSSI marker.

    Returns:
        The body with every digit-only header line replaced by the correct
        byte-count for the immediately-following payload line. Trailing
        newlines, the XSSI prefix, and non-header lines are preserved verbatim.

    Examples:
        Single-chunk body where the payload was scrubbed shorter::

            >>> recompute_chunk_prefix("18\\n[[\\"longer_id_123\\"]]")
            '18\\n[["longer_id_123"]]'
            >>> recompute_chunk_prefix("18\\n[[\\"x\\"]]")
            '7\\n[["x"]]'

        XSSI-wrapped multi-chunk body::

            >>> body = ")]}'\\n\\n10\\n[1,2,3]\\n20\\n[[\\"a\\"]]\\n"
            >>> # After scrubbing one payload from "[1,2,3]" to "[1,2]" the
            >>> # leading "10" header becomes stale; recompute_chunk_prefix
            >>> # rewrites it to match the new payload length.

# The name-anchored ``_cookie_header_replacer`` patterns above scrub only the
# cookie NAMES they enumerate (``SESSION_COOKIES`` + the ``__Secure-*`` /
# ``__Host-*`` umbrellas). Any cookie OUTSIDE those lists kept its real value in
# the committed cassette — confirmed for Google Analytics cookies (``_ga``,
# ``_ga_<id>``, ``_gcl_au``) and one-off cookies like ``AEC`` /
# ``SEARCH_SAMESITE``. Analytics client-ids and timestamps are low-blast-radius
# but they ARE real per-user values, so the bar is: NO cookie value anywhere in
# a committed cassette retains a real value, name-agnostically.
#
# The functions below operate on a single LOGICAL cookie-header value (the
# folded YAML scalar already joined into one string — the recorder hands
# :func:`scrub_request` / :func:`scrub_response` exactly this form, and the gate
# parses the YAML to recover it). They never run over the raw wrapped YAML text,
# so a cookie pair split across a YAML line-wrap boundary can't corrupt anything.
#
# Cookie-header value shape (request ``Cookie:``):  ``name=value; name=value; …``
#   — every ``;``-separated segment is a ``name=value`` cookie pair.
# Set-Cookie value shape (response ``Set-Cookie:``): ``name=value; Attr=x; Attr; …``
#   — ONLY the first segment is the cookie pair; the rest are attributes
#     (``Path`` / ``Domain`` / ``Expires`` / ``Secure`` / ``HttpOnly`` /
#     ``SameSite`` / ``Priority`` / ``Max-Age`` / ``SameParty``) and must be
#     preserved verbatim.

# Reserved Set-Cookie attribute names (lowercased). A segment after the first
# whose key is in this set is an attribute, not a cookie pair, and is left
# untouched. ``Secure`` / ``HttpOnly`` are valueless flags; the rest carry a
# value we must NOT scrub (``Path=/``, ``Domain=.google.com``, ...).

# =============================================================================
# Generic high-entropy / unknown-field credential scan
# =============================================================================
#
# THE KNOWN-SHAPE BOUNDARY (residual-risk decision; ADR-0006, issue #1382).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything ABOVE this point is *name-anchored* (cookie names, WIZ field IDs)
# or *known-shape* (``g.a000-`` / ``sidts-`` / ``ya29.`` / ``AIza`` prefixes).
# That makes the guard NECESSARY-but-not-SUFFICIENT: a credential family the
# registry does not yet know about — a NOVEL token prefix, or a known secret
# riding in an un-targeted JSON field — passes the targeted detectors silently.
# This is not hypothetical: the guard has missed two such shapes historically
# (the ``LSID`` cookie whose name was off the allowlist, and the ``JrWMbf`` WIZ
# field whose API key the name-anchored scrubbers skipped), and #1372 fixed a
# double-encoded-email shape that leaked the maintainer's address. Each fix
# extended the known-shape set by ONE entry — reactive, after-the-leak.
#
# This scanner is the deliberate, field-agnostic complement: it flags a quoted
# JSON string scalar whose ENTIRE value is one long, high-entropy
# base64url/hex run, regardless of the field name carrying it. It is the
# "would have caught it generically" backstop the targeted detectors lack.
#
# Why it is SCOPED to a *quoted scalar value* rather than scanning every token:
# committed cassettes are dense with legitimate high-entropy text — minified
# CSS class names, ``fonts.gstatic.com`` / ``googleusercontent.com`` URLs,
# 1.5 KB hex mind-map blobs, and 600-char ``context=eJw…`` zlib-base64 query
# params. A raw per-token entropy scan would drown in thousands of those false
# positives. But NONE of that legitimate content appears as a *clean quoted
# JSON scalar* (``"field":"<one-pure-token>"``) — which is exactly the shape a
# leaked credential takes when it rides in an unknown field. Anchoring on that
# shape is what makes ZERO false positives across every committed cassette
# achievable while still catching a planted novel token. This residual-risk
# property is therefore a DECISION, not an accident: anything that is NOT a
# quoted high-entropy scalar (a credential split across structural punctuation,
# a token in a non-JSON encoding) remains the backstop's blind spot, covered by
# GitHub secret-scanning and the name-anchored detectors above.
#
# Thresholds (calibrated against every committed cassette — see the unit tests
# ``test_entropy_scan_*`` and ``test_all_committed_cassettes_pass_entropy_scan``):
#
#   * base64url / mixed-alphabet tokens: length >= 40 AND Shannon entropy
#     >= 4.0 bits/char. A 40+ char run drawn from a ~64-symbol alphabet with
#     >=4.0 entropy is a random secret by construction; legitimate quoted
#     scalars in cassettes (UUIDs, opaque IDs) never reach both bars at once.
#   * pure-hex tokens (``[0-9a-fA-F]`` only): a separate length floor of 64,
#     because a 16-symbol alphabet CAPS Shannon entropy at log2(16) = 4.0
#     bits/char — a hex secret can never reliably clear the 4.0 bar, so length
#     alone gates it. 64 hex chars = 256 bits, comfortably above any incidental
#     hex literal (a 32-hex MD5 or a 36-char UUID stays well under the floor).
#
# Allowlist (known-benign long tokens that must NOT be flagged):
#
#   * the canonical ``SCRUB_PLACEHOLDERS`` sentinels (idempotent validation);
#   * the canonical UUID shape (``8-4-4-4-12`` hex-with-dashes) — these are
#     NotebookLM-internal artifact / source / conversation IDs that the
#     surrounding scrubbers deliberately preserve. The base64 length+entropy
#     gate already excludes them (36 chars < 40, dashes depress entropy), but
#     the explicit shape skip documents the intent and guards against a future
#     threshold change re-flagging them.
