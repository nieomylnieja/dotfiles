       per-profile. Without clearing, the first test to poke any profile sets
       the timestamp and subsequent tests in that file see "we just poked"
       and silently skip the POST they're asserting on.
    2. ``_POKE_LOCKS_BY_LOOP`` (``WeakKeyDictionary[loop, WeakValueDictionary[..., Lock]]``) —

       loop is GC'd. In tests the loop typically outlives the explicit
       cleanup point (pytest-asyncio's loop teardown happens after fixtures
       run), so we clear it eagerly to keep tests independent.
    3. ``_SECONDARY_BINDING_WARNED`` — one-shot flag for the Tier 2 cookie
       warning. Reset so tests can independently observe the warning fire.
    4. ``LegacyPromotionScheduler.process_default()`` — the detached retryable
       legacy-account promotion (ADR-0033 PR 5.1). A read of
       a legacy-only profile schedules a background writer, so teardown must
       JOIN it before clearing: a worker still running when the next test
       starts would write into a ``tmp_path`` that test believes it owns, and
       a leftover active-path entry would suppress the very promotion another

    was already there (#2204). Cassettes recorded before that change hold no
    such ``GET_NOTEBOOK``. Without this fixture the read still *fires*: VCR
    refuses it, the add swallows the failure, and the call proceeds with the
    probe disabled — green, and silently not testing the thing it names. In a
    cassette that also records later ``GET_NOTEBOOK``s the miss is worse, since
    the baseline consumes a poll's response and desynchronises the journey.

    Keep those recordings immutable and answer only the missing read. Every
    consumer of this fixture replays a cassette whose create **succeeds**, so
    the probe never runs and the returned value is never compared against
    anything — ``[]`` is the neutral answer, not a claim about the notebook.
    That invariant is enforced rather than trusted: a second call means the
    probe fired, and the fixture fails the test instead of letting an invented
    empty baseline license a match. Every other list still replays from the
    cassette. The probe itself is covered against explicit request sequences in
