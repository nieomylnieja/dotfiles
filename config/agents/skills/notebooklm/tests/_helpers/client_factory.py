    """Build a client shell through the production assembly seam.

    The helper preserves the historical test-only seam kwargs without adding
    them to :class:`NotebookLMClient`'s public constructor: it creates an
    uninitialized instance and runs the same
    :func:`notebooklm._client_assembly._assemble_client` function that
    ``NotebookLMClient.__init__`` delegates to, forwarding the seam kwargs
    that only exist on the assembly function.

    Because the wiring is the production function itself, a constructor
    refactor can no longer strand this factory the way issues #1196
    (open-time upload-semaphore loop reset needed ``_source_uploader``)
    and #1225 (open-time ChatAPI conversation-lock reset needed ``chat``)
    did when this helper still hand-wired private attributes against
    ``NotebookLMClient.__new__``. The shell therefore carries the full
    production attribute surface (feature APIs included) — pinned by
    ``tests/_guardrails/test_client_factory_parity.py``.

    Shell-specific defaults (unchanged from the historical helper):

    - ``refresh_callback=None`` — no auth-refresh coordination unless a
      test injects one (production wires ``client.refresh_auth``).
    - ``keepalive_storage_path`` — passed through verbatim, bypassing the
      production canonicalization (``expanduser().resolve()``) of
      ``auth.storage_path``; an explicit ``None`` still falls through to
      ``compose_client_internals``' own raw ``auth.storage_path``
      fallback, as it always did.
    - The client is returned **unopened**: loop binding still happens at
      ``open()`` time (via ``__aenter__``), exactly as in production.
