"""Live-only contract tests for the MCP tools — the behaviours that mocked unit
tests structurally cannot prove, against the real NotebookLM API.

The headline case is the ``source_ids`` collapse (#1652): the ``studio_generate``
tool deliberately maps BOTH an omitted ``source_ids`` AND an explicit
``source_ids=[]`` to ``None`` ("all sources"), shielding callers from the raw
backend behaviour where ``[]`` means "zero sources" (which the backend refuses).
A mock only proves the resolver *received* ``None``; only a LIVE call proves the
backend actually ACCEPTS the collapsed all-sources request and starts generating.

Also covers not-found resolution, destructive confirm-gating (the entity must
survive a no-confirm call), and the MCP error projection shape. All ``e2e``
(light) so they run nightly.

Requires auth and the ``mcp`` extra (``importorskip``); auto-marked ``e2e`` by
``conftest.pytest_itemcollected``.
