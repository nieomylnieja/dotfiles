"""Live assertion that real traffic reaches the configured app host.

Three layers already pin the host offline, and none of them can fail the way
that matters:

* ``tests/_guardrails/test_public_surface_manifest.py`` pins
  ``DEFAULT_BASE_URL`` to the rebrand host and asserts ``get_base_url()``
  agrees — but that is the *constant*, not the socket.
* ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_host_literals_centralized.py`` forbids a second
  source of truth in ``src/notebooklm/`` — but a path that reads the right
  constant can still be handed to the wrong client.
* VCR replay is structurally incapable of covering this: ``tests/vcr_config.py``
  matches on ``host``, so a cassette replays whatever host it was recorded
  against, and the corpus deliberately retains pre-rebrand entries (#2067).

So the whole offline suite can be green while every live request goes somewhere
else. That gap is what this module closes: it watches the requests a *real*
call actually issues, built through the public constructor the e2e ``client``
fixture uses, so it exercises the path users take rather than a test shell.

Asserted against ``get_base_url()`` rather than a literal, so a run using the
documented ``NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL`` rollback lever (ADR-0028) still passes — the
question here is "does traffic follow the configuration", and the guardrail
above is what pins what the configuration defaults to. When nothing is
configured, this additionally asserts the default resolves to the rebrand host,
so the CI run makes the unconditional statement too.
