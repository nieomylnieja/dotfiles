"""E2E tests for the MCP server against the real NotebookLM API.

Real ``NotebookLMClient`` + real API, marked ``@pytest.mark.e2e`` (added
automatically by ``tests/e2e/conftest.py::pytest_itemcollected`` and required
explicitly here too). The MCP server is driven through FastMCP's in-memory
:class:`fastmcp.Client` against a server whose lifespan binds the real,
already-open ``client`` fixture via the ``client_factory`` seam.

Coverage:

* ``notebook_list`` (read-only) returns the live notebook set.
* The tool manifest: the core tools are present, deletes carry the
  ``destructiveHint`` annotation + a ``confirm`` parameter, and reads carry
  ``readOnlyHint``.
* A full ``create -> describe -> rename -> delete`` lifecycle driven entirely
  through MCP tools, with cleanup.
* Name resolution against live data: resolve a notebook by its title through
  ``notebook_describe`` and confirm it lands on the right id.

These require auth (``requires_auth``) and the ``mcp`` extra
(``pytest.importorskip("fastmcp")``). They are excluded from the default suite
(``addopts = --ignore=tests/e2e``) and only run via ``pytest tests/e2e -m e2e``.
