"""Re-encode a recorded cassette so its response body is gzip-compressed
and the response advertises ``Content-Encoding: gzip``.

Why this exists
---------------
``decode_compressed_response=True`` in :mod:`tests.vcr_config` strips
``Content-Encoding`` from the headers on record (after VCR transparently
gunzips the body), so 89/89 cassettes in ``tests/cassettes/`` carry NO
encoding header and a plaintext body. That hid issue #769 — every RPC
failed in production with ``Error -3 while decompressing data: incorrect
header check`` because :func:`notebooklm._streaming_post.stream_post_with_size_cap`
rebuilt the response with the upstream ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` header
attached to *already-decoded* body bytes, triggering a second gzip-decode
inside :class:`httpx.Response.__init__`. Cassettes that don't carry the
header on replay simply skip that branch and pass.

This script ports a cassette to the production wire shape: gzip the
response body, restore the ``Content-Encoding: gzip`` header, and strip
the now-meaningless ``Transfer-Encoding`` and ``Content-Length`` headers
(the originals described the chunked / decoded wire form, not the gzipped
buffer we hand to vcrpy on replay).

Run from the repo root::

    uv run python tests/scripts/inject_gzip_into_cassette.py \\
        tests/cassettes/artifacts_revise_slide.yaml \\
        tests/cassettes/gzip_coverage/artifacts_revise_slide_gzipped.yaml

Idempotent: re-running on a cassette that already advertises
``Content-Encoding: gzip`` rewrites it from scratch using the gzipped
body that vcrpy has already deserialized to ``bytes``, so a second pass
produces a byte-identical file.

Library use:
    Other tooling can ``from tests.scripts.inject_gzip_into_cassette
    import inject_gzip_into_cassette`` and pass a cassette dict in
    memory.
