"""Per-method RPC coverage gate.

Walks every member of :class:`notebooklm.rpc.types.RPCMethod` and asserts that
each one has **both**:

1. **A test reference** — at least one file under ``tests/`` (excluding the
   coverage gate itself, its allowlist record, and helper data files that
   merely enumerate enum members) mentions the enum member by its qualified
   name (e.g. ``RPCMethod.LIST_NOTEBOOKS``) OR by its raw RPC id string value
   (e.g. ``"wXbhsf"``).
2. **A cassette covering the RPC id** — at least one cassette YAML under
   ``tests/cassettes/`` contains the raw RPC id string in its body. This is a
   pure-text grep — the cassette format is YAML but we never parse it; any
   occurrence of the id within the file counts, because ``batchexecute`` URLs
   and request bodies include the id verbatim.

Either failure prints a single line of the form::

    MISSING: RPCMethod.<NAME> (id=<rpc_id>): <which check failed; suggestion>

and the script exits 1. Exit 0 on full coverage.

Pre-existing-gap allowlist
--------------------------

When this gate first landed, some methods (notably newer or write-rarely
exercised ones) already lacked one or both forms of coverage. Forcing
contributors to backfill cassettes for unrelated methods before they could
ship anything new would have stalled the arc, so the gate accepts a
:data:`PREEXISTING_GAPS` set listing the (RPCMethod-name) entries grandfathered
in at landing time.

The allowlist is intended as a **one-way ratchet**:

* It **must not grow** when a new ``RPCMethod`` member is added — new methods
  must ship with at least one test reference and at least one cassette.
* It **must shrink** when a maintainer backfills coverage for a grandfathered
  method; stale entries in :data:`PREEXISTING_GAPS` fail the gate.

The script is intentionally a static check (pure text grep on the cassette
files and on the contents of ``tests/``); it never runs pytest or imports
anything that needs a network. That keeps it deterministic, fast, and safe
to run as a CI gate on every PR.

Usage::

    uv run python tests/scripts/check_method_coverage.py

Exit codes:
    0 — every method (modulo :data:`PREEXISTING_GAPS`) is covered
    1 — one or more methods are missing required coverage
