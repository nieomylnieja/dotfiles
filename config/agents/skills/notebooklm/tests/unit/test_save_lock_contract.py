"""Regression guard for the ``CookiePersistence.save_lock`` contract.

Contract (documented at ``_cookie_persistence.py`` next to the lock definition):
``save_lock`` is acquired ONLY inside ``CookiePersistence.save``'s ``_save()``
closure, which runs on a worker thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``. It is never
held by an async context — a
blocking ``threading.Lock`` taken on the event-loop thread would stall every
other coroutine (keepalive, RPCs, cancellation) while a sibling worker thread
does file I/O. That is the priority-inversion failure mode this contract
exists to prevent.

These tests are deliberately structural: they verify the rule end-to-end
(via the live ``save_cookies`` path) AND statically (by scanning the cookie
persistence collaborator for any unexpected acquisition site), so a future
refactor that adds an event-loop acquisition fails fast in CI.
