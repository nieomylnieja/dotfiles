"""Tests for the canonical cassette sanitization registry.

The registry lives in :mod:`tests.cassette_patterns` and exports a single
:func:`scrub_string` sanitizer plus an :func:`is_clean` validator. These
tests assert:

- Every cookie shape we know about scrubs cleanly (positive)
- Scrubbing is idempotent on already-scrubbed input (no double-scrub)
- Every placeholder in ``SCRUB_PLACEHOLDERS`` is recognised as clean
- A real cookie value starting with ``S`` IS still flagged as a leak —
  the legacy bash guard used a ``[^S"]`` character class that exempted
  any real secret whose first character was ``S``; the consolidated
  registry uses exact-match placeholder membership to close that hole.
- Registry stays in sync with :mod:`tests.vcr_config`
- Bad-cassette regressions (the shape-lint inputs) are caught by
  :func:`is_clean`. Inline payloads are used so this test does not depend
  on filesystem fixtures.
