"""Unit tests for the transport-neutral ``notebooklm._app.source_listing`` core.

These pin the one piece of genuine ``source list`` business logic at the
``_app`` boundary (independent of the Click adapter): :func:`fetch_sources` and
its label-filter branch — which sources to fetch given an optional label filter.

* No filter → ``client.sources.list(notebook_id)``.
* ``label_filter`` set → injected ``label_resolver`` resolves the ``<id|name>``
  token, then ``client.labels.sources(notebook_id, label_id)`` returns the
  group's members (a single join, no post-filter desync).
* ``json_output`` is forwarded to the resolver only (it never reaches the list).

Pure-service tests (no Click / CliRunner): the ``ListSpec`` / ``prepare_list``
presentation half stays in the CLI adapter and is exercised in
``tests/unit/cli/test_source.py::TestSourceList``.
