"""Host contract for the RPC path (#2067 precursor).

Google serves the personal app from two hosts — ``notebook.google.com`` and,
since the Gemini Notebook rebrand, ``notebook.google.com`` (ADR-0028) — and
``NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL`` selects between them. Two properties of the RPC path
are load-bearing when that selection changes and neither was asserted:

1. **Which host the endpoint builders target under the default env.** Existing
   coverage (``test_rpc_types.py``, ``test_env_base_url.py``) asserts these only
   under the *enterprise* override, so a change to the default was invisible.
2. **That the RPC path sends no origin-bound header.** It sends none today —
   both request builders return an empty header dict, and this client computes
   no ``SAPISIDHASH``. Pinning that makes *adding* one a reviewed decision
   rather than a drive-by, which matters because such a header is bound to a
   host and nothing offline would catch it naming the wrong one.

Both assertions use **bare literals** deliberately. Writing them against
``get_base_url()`` would make them tautologies that pass under any value — the
defect class catalogued in #2055 — and the whole point is to fail loudly if the
default host changes without that change being intended.

The rest of the module pins the third property: **every HTTP-status error names
the host**, on all of the paths a real failure can take — the mapper's 4xx/5xx
arms, its 401/403 fallback, and the retry-exhausted transport 429 that bypasses
the mapper entirely.
