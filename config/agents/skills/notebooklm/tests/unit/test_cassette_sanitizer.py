"""Tests for the cassette sanitizer and the Python guard tool.

Coverage map:

1. Structural display-name scrub — positive + negative cases on
   ``tests/vcr_config.scrub_string``.
2. Two-Capitalized-word source title regression — confirms we don't reintroduce
   the broad ``>[A-Z][a-z]+\\s[A-Z][a-z]+<`` pattern that would clobber legit
   fixture content.
3. Broadened email scrub — positive + idempotency.
4. The Python guard ``tests/scripts/check_cassettes_clean.py``:
   - exits 0 on clean cassettes
   - exits 1 on email / cookie-header / JSON-key / storage_state leaks
   - explicit ``SCRUB_PLACEHOLDERS`` allowlist (NOT a "starts with S"
     heuristic) — closes the cookie-leak gap
   - accepts the ``SCRUBBED`` sentinel in all three cookie shapes
   - honors the repair allowlist by default; ``--strict`` disables it
   - emits ``file:line`` for every leak
   - exits 0 when no cassettes are found at all

The legacy bash-script-driven tests on PR #477 were retired here in lockstep
with the deletion of ``tests/check_cassettes_clean.sh``.
