"""Exact-payload tests for the account-level collection RPC param builders.

These literals are the wire-shape anchor for collections. Collections reuse the
label RPC ids, so they cannot own ``rpc_golden`` fixtures (those are keyed by
``RPCMethod`` name, one per method); this module is the regression contract
instead. The ``create``/remove-membership shapes were corrected against a live
capture (PR #2009, independently confirmed on four accounts) — the original
issue #2006 capture for those two shapes reproducibly failed on the wire.
