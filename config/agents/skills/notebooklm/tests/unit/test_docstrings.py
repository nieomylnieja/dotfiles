"""Guards against `from_storage` docstring drift.

`NotebookLMClient.from_storage` returns an awaitable async-context-manager
wrapper. The canonical idiom is bare ``async with
NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:`` — no ``await``. The
legacy ``async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)`` form
still works (it emits ``DeprecationWarning``; removed in v1.0) and is
the only form we permit in docstrings that explicitly call themselves
out as the migration reference.

For all other docstring example snippets, the parse-validity check below
is enough to keep things honest. The historical "must have `await`"
assertion is gone — that was correct under the old async-coroutine
``from_storage`` and is now exactly what we discourage.

Module docstrings in ``client.py`` and ``__init__.py`` historically
had the inverse bug (bare ``async with`` against a coroutine); this
test exists so future drift in either direction breaks a test instead
of silently shipping a broken example.
