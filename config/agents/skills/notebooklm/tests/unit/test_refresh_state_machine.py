"""Refresh state-machine regression tests.

Pins three behaviors of ``RpcExecutor.try_refresh_and_retry`` (the
canonical implementation; ``Session._try_refresh_and_retry`` was
inlined in PR #4b and callers now reach the executor through
``core._rpc_executor``):

1. Concurrent callers share the same in-flight refresh task (single-flight).
2. Refresh failures propagate to all waiters with chained ``__cause__``.
3. A second wave after the first task completes creates a *new* task
   (the slot is not silently reused).
