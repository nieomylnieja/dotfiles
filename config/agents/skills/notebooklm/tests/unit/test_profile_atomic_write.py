"""Unit tests for unified atomic profile-state write (P1-20).

The pre-P1-20 layout stored Google auth state across two files:

* ``storage_state.json`` — Playwright cookie/origin state.
* ``context.json`` — sibling JSON with ``{"account": {"authuser", "email"}}``
  and CLI notebook/conversation context.

Each file was atomically written on its own. Between the two writes there was
a window in which an external reader (e.g. a long-running ``notebooklm chat``
in a sibling shell) could see either the new cookies bundled with the old
account metadata, or vice versa. Tier-9 P1-20 closes this by bundling the
``account`` record INTO ``storage_state.json`` under a ``notebooklm``
namespace key:

    {
      "cookies": [...],
      "origins": [...],
      "notebooklm": {"version": 1, "account": {"authuser": 1, "email": "..."}}
    }

A single ``atomic_write_json`` is now the only commit point for the
(cookies, account) pair. ``context.json`` keeps holding non-account CLI
state (``notebook_id``, ``conversation_id``); the account key, if still
present from legacy installs, is migrated lazily on next write.

This module covers:

1. Round-trip of the new unified record.
2. Migration: a legacy two-file fixture reads cleanly under the new reader.
3. Migration: writing account metadata after a legacy read drops the
   ``account`` key from ``context.json`` (preserving other CLI state).
4. Torn-write fault injection: if ``storage_state.json`` write fails after
   cookies + account were serialized into the same temp file, the original
   on-disk file is preserved untouched (no half-written state).
5. Login/import replacement keeps this same single profile commit while its
   legacy promote-or-scrub reconciliation remains a later sibling-file step.

    action required.

    Since the master-token-relocation PR-0 (issue #2103), ``read_account_metadata``
    never returns a raw pass-through of the sibling ``context.json[account]``
    record — a standing legacy-sibling fallback on every read meant a missed
    ``authuser`` could silently route requests to a *different* signed-in Google
    account (a #2103-class hazard), so the fallback was removed rather than
    patched at each call site.

    In its place, ``read_account_metadata`` DERIVES the record from the legacy
    sibling read-only, through the same sanitizer promotion embeds with — so
    THIS call, the very first read of any kind (``get_authuser_for_storage``,
    ``get_account_email_for_storage``, ``read_account_metadata`` directly, or
    any future caller), returns the correct value immediately. No caller
    anywhere has to remember an extra promotion step; that is the point of
    putting it at the chokepoint instead of at each of the read helpers built
    on it.

    Since ADR-0033 PR 5.1 the *durable* half is detached: the read schedules a
    one-shot background promotion and does not wait for it, so this test
    drains before asserting on disk state. The correct read values above are
    asserted BEFORE the drain, which is the actual acceptance property — a
    user's binding survives even if the write never lands.

    If this breaks, an existing user loses their account binding
