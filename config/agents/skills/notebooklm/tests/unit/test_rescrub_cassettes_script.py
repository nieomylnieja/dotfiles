"""Unit tests for ``scripts/rescrub-cassettes.py``.

These tests build synthetic "bad" cassettes that contain the exact leak
shapes the script is meant to clean — an ``/ogw/`` avatar URL plus a
chunked WRB response whose declared byte counts are correct for the
pre-scrub payload — then run the script in a tmp_path and assert:

* The output no longer contains the raw avatar URL (the canonical
  ``SCRUBBED_AVATAR_URL`` placeholder appears in its place).
* The chunked ``<count>\\n<payload>\\n`` byte-count prefixes were
  re-derived to match the post-scrub payload byte length — this is the
  ``recompute_chunk_prefix`` pass the script promises to run after
  every string substitution.
* The script is idempotent: a second run on the already-cleaned tree
  reports zero changes and produces a byte-identical file.

One additional regression test asserts the avatar-URL regex the script
hard-codes mirrors the canonical pattern in
``tests/cassette_patterns.py``. The script deliberately does NOT call
``scrub_string`` (see its module docstring), so the registry/script
drift could go unnoticed if the canonical pattern were ever tightened
or widened — this test pins them together.

The script is invoked via :func:`runpy.run_path` rather than imported
in-process — there's a hyphen in its filename (``rescrub-cassettes.py``)
so it isn't a valid Python module name. ``runpy`` handles that cleanly
and the script's exit code surfaces as ``SystemExit`` from its
``__main__`` block.
