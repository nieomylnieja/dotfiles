"""Regression guard for the source-upload single-source-of-truth invariant.

Issue #1326 consolidated all resumable-upload / streaming / file-registration
logic into :class:`notebooklm._source.upload.SourceUploadPipeline`. The public
``SourcesAPI`` surface keeps only *thin delegators* that forward verbatim to the
pipeline; it must never re-grow a parallel implementation of the Scotty upload
protocol.

These tests pin three things:

1. ``SourcesAPI._uploader`` is built from ``_source/upload.py`` — the upload
   implementation collaborator.
2. Every ``SourcesAPI`` upload entry point (``add_file`` and the private
   ``_register_file_source`` / ``_start_resumable_upload`` /
   ``_upload_file_streaming`` / ``_cancel_upload_session`` helpers) forwards its
   arguments unchanged to the matching ``SourceUploadPipeline`` method — verified
   down to the exact positional/keyword shape against the *real* helper
   signatures.
3. ``_sources.py`` carries no resumable-upload HTTP/Scotty implementation of its
   own — neither implementation tokens (token guard) nor anything beyond a
   single delegating ``await self._uploader.<method>(...)`` statement per helper
   (structural guard).
