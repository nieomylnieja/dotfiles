"""exactly-once warning dedupe under a single event loop.

These tests pin the **single-event-loop** case of the documented "best-effort
under threads, exactly-once on a single loop" contract for the two module-level
warning flags re-exported on ``notebooklm.auth`` (canonical owners live on the
``_auth`` seams since D1 PR-2 retired ``_AuthFacadeModule``):

- ``_SECONDARY_BINDING_WARNED`` (canonical owner: ``_auth.cookie_policy``)
- ``_FLOCK_UNAVAILABLE_WARNED`` (canonical owner: ``_auth.storage``)

Both follow the same shape: a synchronous ``if not flag: flag = True; warn()``
block with no ``await`` between the check and the set. The asyncio scheduler
only switches coroutines at ``await`` points, so concurrent coroutines on one
loop cannot interleave inside that block — the warning must fire exactly once
even under ``asyncio.gather(*[N coros])``. We assert that here with N=100.

Thread-mode dedupe is intentionally NOT tested — per the documented
concurrency contract (each client is bound to a single event loop), threading
is out of scope and a duplicate warning under threads is accepted as
best-effort.
