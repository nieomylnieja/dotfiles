"""Tests for ``ResearchAPI.import_sources_with_verification``.

The retry-with-verification logic for ``IMPORT_RESEARCH`` timeouts lives
on ``ResearchAPI`` as of issue #315. These tests were originally in
``tests/unit/cli/test_helpers.py::TestImportWithRetry`` (the logic used to
live in ``cli/research_import.py``); they were moved here when the policy
became a library-layer concern so Python API users get the same fix the
CLI does.

The CLI wrapper ``cli.research_import.import_with_retry`` is now a thin
delegate — its tests cover only the wiring (still in ``test_helpers.py``).
