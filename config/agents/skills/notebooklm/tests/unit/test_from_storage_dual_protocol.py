"""Tests for the dual-protocol wrapper returned by ``NotebookLMClient.from_storage``.

In v0.5.0 ``from_storage`` stopped being an async coroutine and started
returning ``_FromStorageContext`` — an awaitable async-context-manager
wrapper that supports BOTH:

- ``async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:`` (canonical,
  no ``DeprecationWarning``).
- ``async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:`` /
  bare ``await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)`` (legacy, emits
  ``DeprecationWarning`` naming the v1.0 removal).

This module covers both protocols, the deprecation message text, the
type identity of the yielded value, and the lazy-load behavior that
``_FromStorageContext`` itself does no I/O until used.
