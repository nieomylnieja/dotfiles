"""Unit tests for :class:`notebooklm._middleware.tracing.TracingMiddleware`.

PR 12.3 of the Tier-12/13 greenfield migration lands ``TracingMiddleware``
as the innermost middleware in the chain (ADR-0009 §"Chain ordering"). The
middleware is a pure observer: it logs one "starting" record before
``next_call`` and one "completed"/"failed" record after, without
transforming the request or response.

These tests verify:

1. The middleware satisfies the :class:`Middleware` Protocol shape and
   wires through the chain (smoke test via the shared
   :func:`chain_calls_through_to_terminal` fixture).
2. Two log records are emitted around a successful call: one BEFORE
   ``next_call`` ("starting"), one AFTER ("completed" with
   ``status_code`` and ``duration_ms``).
3. ``rpc_method`` / ``log_label`` are propagated from
   ``request.context`` into the log record's ``extra`` mapping (so
   structured-logging consumers see them as ``LogRecord`` attributes).
4. The response returned by the middleware is the exact instance
   returned by ``next_call`` (identity-equal, no rewrap).
5. The request is unchanged after the middleware runs (frozen dataclass
   enforces this at the type level; this test asserts it at runtime to
   guard against a future maintainer relaxing the frozen invariant).
6. On exception from ``next_call``, the middleware emits a "failed"
   record (with ``duration_ms`` and ``exception_type``) and re-raises
   the original exception unchanged.
7. The middleware does NOT raise ``KeyError`` when handcrafted
   middleware-chain fixtures omit ``rpc_method`` from ``request.context``;
   production transport calls always include it.

The tests use stdlib :func:`caplog` to capture log records — no
production logger reconfiguration leaks across tests. The chain is
driven directly via :func:`build_chain` rather than going through
``Session`` so the unit boundary is the middleware itself, not the
full client.
