"""Tests for ``resolve_chat_reference_passage``.

End-to-end exercise of the top-level helper that resolves a
:class:`ChatReference` to its surrounding source-text passage. The
helper composes ``client.sources.get_fulltext`` with
:meth:`SourceFulltext.find_citation_context`, and this test verifies
the full round-trip: a synthesized chat reference with a real cited
substring lands on a non-empty surrounding passage containing that
substring.

The GET_SOURCE response is deterministic and served by ``pytest_httpx``;
no live API or cassette is needed for this coverage.
