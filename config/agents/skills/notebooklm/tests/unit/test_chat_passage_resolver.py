"""Tests for ``resolve_chat_reference_passage``.

End-to-end exercise of the top-level helper that resolves a
:class:`ChatReference` to its surrounding source-text passage. The helper
composes ``client.sources.get_fulltext`` with the citation's own character
range — reading the passage straight out of the source document's coordinate
space — and falls back to the value-based
:meth:`SourceFulltext.find_citation_context` search only when that range is
unusable (#2211). Both paths are exercised here, along with the reasons the
offset path stands aside.

The GET_SOURCE response is deterministic and served by ``pytest_httpx``;
no live API or cassette is needed for this coverage.

    actually sends (``StructuralElement`` rows, each holding its text runs with
    their offsets), which is what makes offset resolution reachable at all.

    Each inner list is one block's **runs**: the sub-paragraph fragments the
    backend splits a paragraph into, and the reason ``content`` renders a
    paragraph as several lines. An ``int`` in place of a list is a block that
    occupies that many positions and decodes no text — an image or a rule.

    Offsets are laid out with :func:`utf16_len`, not ``len`` — the wire counts
    UTF-16 code units, so a block containing an emoji occupies one more
    position than it has Python characters, and a builder using ``len`` here
    would quietly encode this client's old misreading instead of the wire's
    convention.
