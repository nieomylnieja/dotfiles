"""Offline MCP tool-surface eval harness (ADR-0025 tripwire).

Static, deterministic, no live model — it measures the two things a mock-client
harness *can* measure honestly and ratchets them so the surface can't silently
bloat:

* **schema-token cost** — a char proxy (serialized ``inputSchema`` + description
  length) per tool and surface-wide. Leaner descriptions / fewer params cost less
  agent context every call.
* **schema-ambiguity proxy** — per-tool visible param count. A tool with a huge
  param list is the "one tool mirrors N backend operations" smell (ADR-0025's
  mega-tool discussion). Ratcheting the max catches a `source_add` /
  `studio_generate` that grows further, or a new mega-tool.

Live tool-selection accuracy is intentionally NOT measured here (it needs a real
model); it is out of scope for this offline harness.

Run ``pytest tests/unit/mcp/test_tool_eval.py -s`` to see the per-tool table.

#: Ratchet ceilings — calibrated to the current surface (Tier-1 read-merge took it
#: to ~36.0k). Move these DOWN as the surface gets leaner; a rise means
#: description/param bloat that must be justified, not rubber-stamped.
SCHEMA_CHAR_BUDGET = (
    39_050  # total serialized inputSchema + description chars (current 39_015; +35 slack)
)
# #1896 folded studio_get_prompt into studio_list (each artifact's generation_prompt
# rides the default summary listing / the item= single-fetch), a net −1 tool and
# −367 schema chars. Ratcheted DOWN from 39_400 to the new 39_015 actual (don't leave
# freed slack).
# #1914 normalized studio_generate's mind-map payload to the bare node tree (behavior,
# not new params); its docstring note the tree/``null`` shape is +18 chars (39_361 →
# 39_379), absorbed within the existing cap.
# Budget skew (#1912 + #1913): #1909's warts trim and #1908's mind-map note each
# merged individually-green, but were measured against a main WITHOUT the other, so
# their COMBINED total (39_451) breached this cap. Fixed by trimming redundant prose
# from studio_generate's docstring (the per-kind validation example and the comma
# source-title aside) — cap held at 39_400, no behavior change.
# #1908 documented studio_generate's mind-map exception (mind-map renders
# synchronously → NO pollable task_id; the rendered map is returned inline under
# mind_map). Absorbed within the existing budget, partly by trimming the redundant
# "style is shared by video and infographic" sentence (already covered by the
# per-kind bullets).
# #1890 folded the two source-add composites BACK into source_add (ADR-0025 tool
# consolidation): the add+wait verb → source_add(wait=True, timeout=, interval=), and
# the in-channel byte upload → source_add(source_type="file", bytes_base64=, filename=).
# source_add grew to 15 params / ~4.9k chars for the merged surface, but removing
# source_add_and_wait + source_upload_bytes is a net −2 tools and −3_099 schema chars.
# Ratcheted DOWN from 42_450 to the new 39_319 actual (don't leave freed slack).
# Phase 1 (remote MCP file upload) added await_upload — the completion signal for a
# source_add(source_type="file") link, so the model learns the browser/mobile upload
# landed without the user narrating it. A NEW discrete tool (+773 chars, 2 params:
# upload_link, timeout), not growth of an existing one; per ADR-0025 the discrete verb
# is preferred over widening source_add, and the docstring is kept lean. It reuses the
# existing ADR-0024 signer + in-process jti store (no new state), so this is the whole
# schema cost. Raised from 41_700.
# #1884 added source_add_drive_file (auto-route add-from-Drive: download + upload the
# upload-only Drive types NotebookLM's native import can't ingest) — a NEW discrete
# tool (+1_144 chars, 4 params), not growth of an existing one. Per ADR-0025 the
# discrete verb is preferred over widening source_add(source_type="drive"), which
# REQUIRES an explicit mime_type (#1827) and only imports Google-native + PDF by
# reference; auto-download is a categorically different operation. Raised from 40_550.
# Prior baseline: current was 40_501, +37 for source_add's batch docstring documenting
# the #1871 fatal-abort semantics (a per-URL input failure isolates, a fatal service
# failure aborts the whole call).
# ^ Raised from 36_250 for #1741: research_status gained include_report /
# report_max_chars / source_limit / source_offset windowing params, and the four
# research tools' docstrings speak one `poll_task_id` id (tightened to stay lean).
# #1789 renamed research_status/import's `task_id` and research_cancel's `run_id`
# params to `poll_task_id` (keeping the old names as deprecated aliases → one extra
# param each), absorbed by trimming the now-redundant id-routing prose from those
# docstrings; measured full-surface cost is 36_934. The ceiling is a deliberately
# minimal buffer (ADR-0025) — trim before adding more.
# #1803 added source_upload_bytes (the in-channel small-file byte-upload for the
# network-boxed-agent dead-zone) — a NEW discrete tool (+1_581 chars, 5 params),
# not growth of an existing one; ADR-0025 prefers a discrete verb over widening the
# source_add mega-tool, whose schema-budget headroom this would otherwise consume.
# Measured full-surface cost is 38_572.
# #1807 added source_add_and_wait (single-mode source_add + source_wait composed into
# one call — the add→wait round-trip an agent otherwise makes itself) — another NEW
# discrete tool (~1_920 chars, 11 params), not growth of an existing one; same
# ADR-0025 discrete-verb rationale as source_upload_bytes. Measured full-surface cost
# is 40_412 (after the #1806 / #1805 rebase, which shifted the baseline).
