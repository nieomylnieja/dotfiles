"""Round-trip tests for the cassette cookie sanitizer.

The ``SENSITIVE_PATTERNS`` list in :mod:`tests/vcr_config.py` claims to redact
every Google session cookie before a cassette hits disk, but until this test
existed nothing actually proved that the regexes catch the names they enumerate.
This module covers BOTH cookie shapes that show up in a VCR cassette payload:

1. **Playwright ``storage_state`` JSON shape**: ``{"cookies": [{"name": "SID",
   "value": "<secret>", "domain": ...}]}`` — what gets serialized when a
   storage_state dump leaks into a recorded response body.
2. **HTTP ``Cookie:`` header shape**: ``"SID=<secret>; SAPISID=<secret2>; ..."``
   — what the ``Cookie`` request header carries and what ``Set-Cookie`` response
   headers echo back.

For each shape the tests assert:

* every protected cookie name has its value scrubbed (no secret survives);
* scrubbing is idempotent (running twice yields the same output);
* unrelated cookie names (``BSID``, ``SAPISIDS``) are NOT scrubbed — i.e. the
  patterns are anchored tightly enough to avoid scrubbing legitimate fixture
  content;
* the ``__Secure-...`` family — including ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` which the
  protected-name list does not enumerate explicitly — is caught by the generic
  ``__Secure-[^=]+`` (cookie-header form) / ``__Secure-[^"]+`` (JSON form)
  family patterns.

Regression context (two fixes landed alongside this test file):

* Pre-fix, the existing patterns only matched the ``Cookie: SID=...; HSID=...``
  header form and never fired on the JSON ``{"name": "SID", "value": "..."}``
  storage_state form. A leaked ``storage_state.json`` therefore round-tripped
  through the sanitizer untouched. The fix added two structural JSON patterns
  (``name``-before-``value`` and the reversed defensive ordering) to
  ``SENSITIVE_PATTERNS`` in ``tests/vcr_config.py``.
* Pre-fix, the header-form regexes were also unanchored, so a benign cookie
  named ``BSID`` was scrubbed as a side effect (its ``SID=...`` tail matched
  the protected ``SID=[^;]+`` regex). The fix prepends a negative lookbehind
  ``(?<![A-Za-z0-9_-])`` to each cookie-name regex so only cookie-name-boundary
  matches fire. ``SAPISID`` already escaped this because ``SAPISIDS`` doesn't
  contain a literal ``SAPISID=`` substring at the right boundary, but ``BSID``
  did, hence the explicit fix.
