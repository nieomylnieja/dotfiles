    The RPC POST path uses :meth:`httpx.AsyncClient.stream` (so a running
    size guard can enforce :data:`notebooklm._streaming_post.MAX_RPC_RESPONSE_BYTES`).
    The bulk of the unit suite predates that switch and still expresses test
    intent as ``monkeypatch.setattr(client, "post", fake_post)``. This helper
    bridges the gap: it installs an ``async with client.stream(...)``-compatible
    fake on ``http_client.stream`` that delegates to the caller's existing
    ``fake_post`` (preserving call-count side effects, raised exceptions, and
    returned responses).

    For ``MagicMock`` responses lacking real ``aiter_bytes`` plumbing, the
    helper attaches a single-chunk async iterator over the mock's ``.text`` so
    the streaming wrapper's size-guard read loop terminates immediately.
    Real :class:`httpx.Response` instances are passed through unchanged —
    their built-in ``aiter_bytes`` works on already-buffered bodies.
