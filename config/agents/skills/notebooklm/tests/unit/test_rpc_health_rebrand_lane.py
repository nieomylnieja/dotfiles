"""Guard the rebrand-host lane's ISOLATION in ``.github/workflows/rpc-health.yml``.

The nightly health workflow files its "Non-transient ERROR detected" issue with
a dedup probe that searches **by title alone**. So an issue-filing lane that can
fail every night is not merely noisy — after its first issue opens, the dedup
check suppresses every subsequent issue sharing that title, including the
main health-check degradation issue.

The rebrand-host probe (``notebook.google.com``) therefore gets its own titles,
a dedup key PER CAPABILITY, and a *state-change* trigger rather than a recurring
error. It can report either direction without changing the main lane's exit code.

The same reasoning applies one level down (#2062): the lane's state file is the
next run's baseline, so anything it records must have been genuinely observed
tonight and genuinely reported. Hence the two further invariants pinned here —
the document read back must be one this run wrote, and a transition that could
not be reported must not advance the cached baseline.

These assertions are cheap and the failure they prevent is silent and total —
a suppressed alarm looks identical to a healthy night.
