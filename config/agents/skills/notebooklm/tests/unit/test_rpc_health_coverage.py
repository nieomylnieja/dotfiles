"""Coverage assertion for the RPC-health canary.

``scripts/check_rpc_health.py`` already enumerates every ``RPCMethod`` and
prints a per-method row, but until now there was no CI guard that *every*
new enum entry is either (a) actively probed by the canary or (b)
explicitly classified as intentionally-not-probed. Without that guard, a
new entry can land silently and stay unmonitored.

This test pins the classification: every ``RPCMethod`` member must be in
exactly one of four categories:

1. **Probed** — ``get_test_params`` returns non-None test params AND the
   method is not short-circuited by ``ALWAYS_SKIP_METHODS``, so the
   canary will exercise the RPC and confirm its ID still echoes back.
2. **MUTATING_SKIP_LIST** — create/update/delete/generate writes. These
   either mutate state (only safe in ``--full`` mode against a throwaway
   notebook) or kick off long-running server-side tasks. They are NEVER
   probed in the read-only quick canary; full mode handles them via
   ``setup_temp_resources`` / ``cleanup_temp_resources``.
3. **PATH_NOT_METHOD_SKIP** — entries that hold a URL path string rather
   than a batchexecute RPC ID. They cannot be probed via the RPC pipeline.
4. **UNAVAILABLE_SKIP_LIST** — RPCs that exist in the enum but are not
   currently exercisable (e.g. server-side not fully rolled out). Listed
   so a future rollout can move them back into the probe set.

If a new ``RPCMethod`` is added without classification, this test fails
with a message naming the unclassified member so the contributor must
make an explicit decision.
