"""The account read path takes no locks and issues no writes (ADR-0033 PR 5.1).

``account.read_account_metadata`` is documented as a fast, lock-free read and
sits on the per-RPC token-route path (``refresh._resolve_token_route_kwargs``
-> ``get_authuser_for_storage`` -> here). It used to call
``promote_legacy_account`` inline whenever the in-band record was absent, which
took the storage WRITE lock — the read wrote. The 2-second promotion deadline
and the per-path warning throttle existed only to compensate for that.

Now the read DERIVES its answer read-only from the legacy sibling and returns;
the durable promotion is a detached single-flight per canonical path. Completed
workers leave the path retryable, and an in-band winner with a stale sibling
schedules the privacy scrub, so interrupted migrations self-heal. This module is
the proof, in four parts:

1. **The derivation is indistinguishable from the promotion** (the
   anti-wrong-account contract). A missed or mangled ``authuser`` routes
   requests to a *different* signed-in Google account, so "we can answer
   without writing" is only true if the answer is byte-identical to what the
   write would have produced. Proven field-by-field over a matrix of legacy
   shapes, including the malformed ones.
2. **Zero locks on the read.** Not "a short lock" — none, on either branch.
3. **Retryable single-flight.** N concurrent readers produce ONE promotion;
   after that worker settles, a later read can retry a transient failure.
4. **All three entry paths reach reconciliation** (per-RPC, CLI, env-auth) —
   the precondition for deleting the deadline and the throttle at all.
