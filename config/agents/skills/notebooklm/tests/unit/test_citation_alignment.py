"""Citation-alignment tests built on live-captured wire payloads (#2120, #2128).

Every fixture here is a **real** response body, not a hand-built row:

* ``tests/unit/fixtures/chat_answer_row_with_citations.json`` — the answer
  record (``inner_data[0]``) of a ``GenerateFreeFormStreamed`` response to a
  three-part question over a plain-text source. It carries a 536-character
  answer, the answer's own ``responseDoc`` with a 3-entry annotation map, and
  three citations whose fragments hold 12, 10 and 10 blocks.
* ``tests/unit/fixtures/source_fulltext_tailwind_doc.json`` — a ``GET_SOURCE``
  fulltext response for a markdown source, exercising every structural feature
  the flat extractor discarded: ``HEADING_1``/``2``/``3``, a bulleted list and
  a numbered list.

That provenance is the point. The bugs these tests cover survived a large
synthetic suite precisely because the synthetic rows encoded the code's belief
about the wire rather than the wire: a fixture shaped like
``[[start, end, payload]]`` "proved" the passage loop worked, when the real
payload nests one level deeper and made the loop run exactly once.

The numbers asserted below are the capture's own — 556 characters of cited
text where the pre-fix client returned 37, an annotation at ``[219, 235]``
reading ``"into electricity"`` — so a regression shows up as a wrong number
rather than as a fixture that quietly agrees with whatever the code does.
