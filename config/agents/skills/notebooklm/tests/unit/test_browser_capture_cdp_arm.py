"""Unit tests for the CDP-attach arm of browser capture (``run_cdp_capture``).

An alternative credential source for layer-3 re-auth: instead of launching the
dedicated persistent profile, attach to an operator-pointed already-running
Chrome over the Chrome DevTools Protocol. The motivation is freshness — the
operator's daily Chrome is continuously Google-refreshed where our dedicated
profile can go stale in the long-idle case.

Covers:

* authenticated landing (lands on the NotebookLM host) → capture / filter /
  atomically persist ``storage_state.json`` (the SAME path the other arms use);
* redirected off-host → raise :class:`HeadlessLoginRequiredError` loudly (the
  attached browser's session cannot reach NotebookLM); NEVER persists;
* lifecycle: teardown only DISCONNECTS (``browser.close()``) and never closes
  the operator's context;
* the same cookie-domain allowlist applies, so the on-disk state is equivalent
  regardless of the credential source.

The Playwright client is faked via ``patch("playwright.sync_api.sync_playwright")``
so no real browser / network is required and ``playwright`` stays lazily
imported.
