"""Cookie-domain preservation guardrail for the two maintenance scripts (#2019).

``scripts/check_rpc_health.py`` and ``scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py`` both
authenticate against live Google hosts, and both used to load credentials
through the *flat* ``load_auth_from_storage()`` mapping, which drops every
cookie's domain. Under ``NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`` (how the nightly workflows run)
there is no storage file to recover the domains from, so:

* ``check_rpc_health`` fed the flat dict to ``fetch_tokens``, whose
  ``build_cookie_jar`` fallback re-pinned **every** cookie to ``.google.com``;
* ``capture_rpc_registry`` handed the flat dict straight to
  ``httpx.get(cookies=...)``, which is domain-less by construction.

Host-scoped cookies (``OSID`` / ``__Secure-OSID`` on the NotebookLM host,
``LSID`` on ``accounts.google.com``) were therefore broadcast to every
``*.google.com`` host. After Google's ``notebook.google.com`` cutover the
sign-in redirect chain mints a fresh host ``OSID``; the stale broadcast copy
collides with it and the chain dead-ends on
``accounts.google.com/CookieMismatch``, which the scripts then misreported as
"Authentication expired or invalid".

The live rpc-health workflow cannot gate a PR, so these offline tests pin the
contract instead. Two properties matter, and the fixture is built so neither can
be satisfied by accident:

* the jar each script authenticates with mirrors the ``storage_state`` domains;
* **a specific cookie value never reaches a host it was not scoped to.** The
  fixture deliberately carries ``OSID`` on *both* the NotebookLM host and
  ``accounts.google.com`` with different values, because same-name-different-
  domain is the entire reason domains matter — a name-only assertion
  (``"OSID" not in sent``) would be wrong here, and flattening destroys the
  accounts-scoped value outright.
