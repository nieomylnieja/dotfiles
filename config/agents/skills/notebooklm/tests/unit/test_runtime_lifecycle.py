"""Unit tests for :mod:`notebooklm._runtime.lifecycle`.

Covers the load-bearing behaviors of :class:`ClientLifecycle` directly, in
addition to the existing ``Session``-shaped tests in
``test_session_close.py`` / ``test_client_keepalive.py`` / ``test_vcr_config.py``
which exercise the same helper through the compat facade.

Specifically pinned here:

* :meth:`ClientLifecycle.open` is **idempotent** — a second call while the
  client is already open is a no-op (the first ``httpx.AsyncClient`` instance
  is preserved).
* :meth:`ClientLifecycle.close` **cancels and awaits the keepalive task
  cleanly** — the task exits and is set to ``None``; the call doesn't leak a
  ``CancelledError``.
* ``_bound_loop`` **mismatch raises ``RuntimeError``** — the cross-loop guard
  in :meth:`RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post` reads ``_bound_loop`` through
  the lifecycle and raises actionably when the loops differ.
* :meth:`ClientLifecycle.save_cookies` **invokes** the
  :class:`CookiePersistence` collaborator's ``save`` method with the right
  ``jar`` and ``path`` arguments AND with the ``save_cookies_to_storage``
  value resolved from ``notebooklm._auth.storage`` at call time.
* The httpx ``AsyncClient`` **always uses httpx's default transport** —
  Tier-12 PR 12.6 lifted synthetic-error injection into the chain
  (:class:`notebooklm._middleware.error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`)
  and PR 12.9 deleted the legacy ``_SyntheticErrorTransport`` class.
  The lifecycle constructs a plain transport regardless of
  ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS``.
* :meth:`ClientLifecycle._keepalive_loop` **respects the min-interval
  clamp** — ``_resolve_keepalive_interval`` floors the configured interval
  at ``keepalive_min_interval`` so a sub-floor user value gets bumped up.

Tests are intentionally helper-shaped (instantiate :class:`ClientLifecycle`
directly with a stub collaborator bundle) so they cover the lifecycle
without taking on a ``Session`` dependency. Wave 2 of plan
``host-protocol-removal`` narrowed the lifecycle method signatures from
the legacy Session-shaped ``host`` Protocol to explicit keyword-only
collaborators; the :class:`_StubHost` fixture now serves purely as a
convenience bundle, paired with module-level :func:`_open` / :func:`_close`
adapters that unpack the bundle into the new kwarg shape.

class _StubHost:
    """Test-side collaborator bundle for :class:`ClientLifecycle` unit tests.

    Wave 2 of plan ``host-protocol-removal`` narrowed the four
    :class:`ClientLifecycle` methods to take explicit keyword-only
    collaborators rather than a Session-shaped ``host`` Protocol. This
    fixture survives as a convenience bundle — it holds the same set of
    stub collaborators every lifecycle test needs (auth, drain tracker,
    auth coordinator, reqid counter, cookie persistence) in one place,
    so each test can do ``lifecycle.open(auth=host.auth,
    drain_tracker=host._drain_tracker, ...)`` without re-building five
    mocks at every call site.

    Mirrors the live ``Session`` attribute names for grep continuity:

    * ``auth`` — a real :class:`AuthTokens` so :meth:`ClientLifecycle.open`
      can read ``cookies`` / ``cookie_jar`` / ``storage_path``.
    * ``_drain_tracker`` / ``_auth_coord`` / ``_reqid`` — ``MagicMock``s;
      the lifecycle calls ``_drain_tracker.reset_after_open()`` (Wave 1
      of host-protocol-removal replaced the legacy direct
      ``_drain_tracker._draining = False`` write) and ``set_bound_loop``
      on each of the three helpers (drain / reqid / auth_coord) from the
      open() path so cross-loop misuse can be caught.
    * ``cookie_persistence`` — a ``MagicMock`` with an async ``save``
      coroutine; assertions check it was called with the right args.
    * ``_drain_tracker.run_drain_hooks`` — called by close(); set to an
      ``AsyncMock`` so tests can assert it ran and inspect call order.

    Stage B1 PR 2 of the post-refactoring plan dropped the close-time
    ``host._rpc_executor = None`` line from
    :meth:`ClientLifecycle.close` — the executor now persists across
    ``close()`` → ``open()`` cycles. The corresponding sentinel and the
    ``test_close_nulls_rpc_executor`` regression test were removed in
    that PR; see :mod:`tests.unit.test_lifecycle_executor_reuse` for
    the replacement contract.
