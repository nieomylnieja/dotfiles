"""Tests for the open-time snapshot + dirty-flag merge in
``save_cookies_to_storage`` — the fix for issue #361 (stale in-memory
cookies clobbering fresh disk state) and the side-effect closure of
``docs/auth-cookie-lifecycle.md`` Appendix A2 (path collapse).

The canonical race that motivated this code (#361):

    Process A and Process B both share the same ``storage_state.json``.
    A loads ``*PSIDTS=OLD`` at open time and never rotates.
    B rotates ``*PSIDTS`` to ``NEW`` and writes to disk.
    A's ``close()`` reads disk under flock, sees its in-memory ``OLD``
    differs from disk's ``NEW``, and "merges" by writing ``OLD`` —
    silently undoing B's rotation.

The fix is an open-time snapshot per client runtime, plus a
``save_cookies_to_storage`` mode that writes only the deltas relative to
that snapshot. Cookies the in-process code never touched are left to
disk; sibling-process writes survive.

        ``test_cas_protects_across_leading_dot_variant``.

        Timeline:

        1. Disk row for ``OSID`` uses the bare-host domain
           ``accounts.google.com``.
        2. ``AuthTokens.from_storage`` loads the jar, then the mocked token
           fetch rotates ``OSID`` and re-keys it on the leading-dot variant
           ``.accounts.google.com`` (the domain variance the CAS / baseline
           code must paper over). Inside the same mock, a sibling process
           rewrites disk's bare-host row to a third value.
        3. The pre-client save runs through real
           ``save_cookies_to_storage``: the variant-aware CAS lookup spots
           the disk drift via the bare-host snapshot entry and rejects the
           dotted delta. ``from_storage`` then runs the real
           ``advance_cookie_snapshot_after_save``, which must preserve the
           bare-host baseline rather than dropping the key.
        4. Client open preserves the load-time comparison point (OLD), because
           the live jar was derived from that state. A Set-Cookie aligns the
           live dotted variant to disk; convergence and a later rotation then
           retain the authoritative bare-row identity without re-clobbering.
