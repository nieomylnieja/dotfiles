"""Unit tests for the headless arm of ``run_browser_capture`` (layer-3 re-auth).

Covers the landing-URL classifier and the no-human contract:

* authenticated landing (lands on the NotebookLM host) → capture / filter /
  atomically persist ``storage_state.json`` (reusing the P1 path); NEVER waits
  for a human.
* redirected to the Google login page → raise
  :class:`HeadlessLoginRequiredError` loudly (the profile's session is also
  dead); NEVER hangs on ``wait_for_url``.
* the ``(headless, interactive)`` mode guard: only the two sanctioned arms are
  accepted.

The Playwright context is faked via ``patch("playwright.sync_api.sync_playwright")``
(the same shape the existing login-coverage suite uses), so no real browser /
network is required and ``playwright`` stays lazily imported.
