"""Tests for cross-process locking in :func:`migrate_to_profiles`.

The migration moves legacy flat-layout files into ``profiles/default/`` and
must run as a single writer: two ``notebooklm`` CLI invocations starting
under a fresh home (e.g., container start-up race) would otherwise both
copy + delete, leaving partial state visible to either.

Critical invariants exercised here:

* Two concurrent threads → exactly one copy is performed; the second
  observes the marker inside the lock and no-ops.
* Pre-existing partial state (a legacy source dir removed mid-migration)
  does not crash the loser of the race.
* The lock file is intentionally left on disk after migration completes
  (``filelock`` reuses lock files across runs — see ``_atomic_io.py``).
* A held lock surfaces :class:`MigrationLockTimeoutError` rather than
  blocking forever.
