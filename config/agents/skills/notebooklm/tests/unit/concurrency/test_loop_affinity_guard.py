"""Unit tests for the loop-affinity guard (P0-2).

The free helper :func:`notebooklm._loop_affinity.assert_bound_loop` is the
new shared chokepoint that every async entry point on the seam helpers
(``_transport_drain.TransportDrainTracker.drain``,
``_reqid_counter.ReqidCounter.next_reqid``,
``_runtime.auth.AuthRefreshCoordinator.await_refresh``,
``_artifact.polling.ArtifactPollingService.wait_for_completion``,
``_chat.ChatAPI.ask``,
``_source.upload.SourceUploadPipeline.add_file``) now consults so a cross-loop call surfaces an
actionable ``RuntimeError`` at the call site rather than hanging on a
lock bound to a dead loop.

The guard in ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`` already covers the
transport-POST path. The shared guard extends the same contract to the
four async entry points that don't pass through that POST path (drain,
reqid, auth refresh, artifact polling) and to the chat-ask/upload locks
that the transport path only catches *after* a loop-bound acquire — too late.

Acceptance:
- ``bound_loop=None`` is a silent no-op (lazy / unopened helpers).
- ``bound_loop=<current loop>`` is a silent no-op (steady state).
- ``bound_loop=<a different loop>`` raises ``RuntimeError`` with the same
  diagnostic the transport guard uses.
- Each of the 6 guarded entry points calls :func:`assert_bound_loop` with
  its own bound-loop reference before any awaits that touch loop-bound
  primitives (so cross-loop misuse never hits the lock-wait path).
