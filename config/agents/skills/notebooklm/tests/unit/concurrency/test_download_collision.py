"""Regression test for the concurrent download temp-file collision.

Audit item #1 (`thread-safety-concurrency-audit.md` §1):
Pre-fix, two concurrent `_download_url(...)` calls targeting the same
`output_path` shared a single `<output>.tmp` file, interleaving bytes
and racing on `temp_file.rename(output_file)`. Post-fix, each
call uses `tempfile.mkstemp(...)` for a unique temp path and commits
via `os.replace`, so concurrent writers cannot corrupt the final file.

This test exercises the previously-broken path directly via
`client.artifacts._download_url`, intercepting the internal
`httpx.AsyncClient` with the `httpx_mock` fixture.

    Object-form seam patch (ADR-0007): the cookie loader is referenced as

    an import-string target. The fixture yields the stub and asserts on
