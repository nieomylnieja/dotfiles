"""Regression test for the close-cancellation transport-leak shield.

The audit covered whether the ``asyncio.shield`` wrapped around
``self._kernel.http_client.aclose()`` inside lifecycle close correctly
survives a cancellation that lands while ``aclose`` itself is
in flight, exercised through the user-facing ``__aexit__`` surface (not
the bare ``close()`` task path already covered by the companion
``test_cancel_mid_close_does_not_leak_transport``).

The shield itself ships earlier (PR #526, sha ``d8b5bd6``). The
follow-up acceptance criterion was a complementary repro that exercises
a different cancel-injection site:

- Client opened with ``keepalive=...`` so a background poke task is alive
  and the close sequence has to drive a real keepalive teardown.
- ``_rotate_cookies`` monkeypatched to hang on an unset ``asyncio.Event``
  so the keepalive task is genuinely parked when close starts cancelling
  it. CancelledError is intentionally NOT trapped — the keepalive task
  must remain cancellable so that ``client.close()`` can tear it down and
  reach the shielded ``aclose`` block.
- The httpx client's ``aclose`` is also monkeypatched to insert a short
  ``await asyncio.sleep(0.2)`` so the close path doesn't run to
  completion in microseconds; otherwise the outer ``wait_for`` timeout
  would never fire and the cancel-during-aclose path the shield
  protects would never be exercised.
- ``__aexit__`` driven through :func:`asyncio.wait_for(timeout=0.1)` so
  the outer cancel reliably arrives while the slowed ``aclose`` is in
  flight — i.e. inside the shielded await.
- We hold a reference to ``client._collaborators.kernel.http_client`` captured before
  the cancel (close nulls the attribute on success) and assert
  ``http_client_ref.is_closed`` is true afterwards — proof that the
  shielded ``aclose`` in the outer ``finally`` ran to completion.

The shield satisfies this invariant; the follow-up source change was
intentionally a no-op (the audit's job was to confirm the shield is
positioned correctly, which it is). This test is the regression
artifact — verified to fail loudly when the shield is removed (the
cancelled-mid-``aclose`` path then leaves ``is_closed=False``).

    Sibling test to ``test_close_during_keepalive_cancel_does_not_leak_transport``
    above. That test covers the shielded inner-close path (cancel lands
    *inside* ``aclose`` while lifecycle close is already running). This
    test covers the **outer-wrapper** path (cancel lands while
    ``NotebookLMClient.close()`` is still awaiting ``self.drain(...)``,
    i.e. BEFORE lifecycle close is reached). Audit finding I12
    (``architecture-audit.md``) flagged that the public wrapper at
    ``client.py:close()`` awaits ``self.drain(...)`` *before* calling
    lifecycle close with no protection; if the caller task is
    cancelled while drain is parked on an in-flight operation,
    ``CancelledError`` propagates out of ``close()`` and the shielded
    lifecycle close / ``Kernel.aclose()`` never runs — leaking the
    live ``httpx.AsyncClient``.

    Repro setup:

    - Open the client.
    - Capture ``http_client_ref`` BEFORE the cancel (successful close
      nulls the kernel's transport attribute).
    - Monkeypatch ``client._collaborators.drain_tracker.drain`` to park on an
      unset ``asyncio.Event`` so drain() blocks indefinitely; the only
      exit is the ``CancelledError`` injected by the outer ``wait_for``
      deadline. The public ``NotebookLMClient.drain`` reaches the
      tracker directly.
    - Drive ``close(drain=True)`` through ``asyncio.wait_for(timeout=0.1)``
      so the cancel reliably lands while ``drain`` is parked.

    Expected invariant (regression assertion):

    - After the cancel, ``client.is_connected`` must be ``False`` AND
      ``http_client_ref.is_closed`` must be ``True`` — proving the outer
      wrapper drove lifecycle close to completion despite the cancel
      that fired mid-drain. Pre-fix this assertion fails: cancel exits
