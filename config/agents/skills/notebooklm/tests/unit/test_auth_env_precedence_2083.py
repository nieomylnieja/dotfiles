"""Env-auth precedence contracts for issue #2083.

``NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`` supplies auth inline, with no writable backing file.
``cli.services.auth_source.AuthSource`` documents the precedence — explicit
``--storage`` > env var > profile file — but three library call sites used to
spell the predicate themselves and two ranked the profile *above* the env var.
The observable consequence was a client assembled from two accounts: the CLI's
``get_client`` resolved the path through ``AuthSource`` (``None`` for env auth)
and passed the profile alongside, so the token fetch re-resolved to the profile
file while the cookie jar came from the env var.
