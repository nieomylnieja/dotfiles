"""SSRF / #1521 coverage for ``CurlCffiAsyncClient.get_guarded`` (hermetic).

``get_guarded`` replicates the httpx ``redirect_guard`` event-hook behavior for
the opt-in curl_cffi transport: it follows redirects manually
(``allow_redirects=False``) and re-validates every hop's scheme + host against
the injected predicate BEFORE connecting.

Two layers are pinned here:

* **Pre-request host validation** — bad initial/redirect hosts are rejected
  before any curl call (so these need no network). The key vector is the one
  Codex flagged: curl_cffi's ``requote_uri`` un-escapes ``%2e``→``.``, so the
  guard must validate the RAW host (which still contains ``%``) and never the
  decoded form.
* **Redirect-loop mechanics** — the underlying ``self._curl.get`` is stubbed so
  we can drive 302 chains deterministically AND assert the SSRF-critical request
  flags (``allow_redirects=False`` + ``quote=False``) on every hop.
