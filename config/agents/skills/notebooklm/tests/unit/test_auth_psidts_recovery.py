"""Tests for inline ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` recovery (issue #865).

Covers :mod:`notebooklm._auth.psidts_recovery` and its integration into
:func:`notebooklm.auth.load_auth_from_storage`. The recovery breaks a closed
loop in the cold-start preflight: when ``storage_state.json`` lacks PSIDTS but
carries ``SID`` + a valid secondary binding, the preflight rejects before the
keepalive's ``RotateCookies`` POST can heal the state. This module's tests pin
the precondition gate, the throttle, the persistence, and the load-path
integration so the loop stays broken.
