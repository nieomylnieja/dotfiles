"""Close-ordering contract for ``TransportDrainTracker`` drain hooks (ADR-0014 Rule 1).

Wave 2 of the session-decoupling plan moved the drain-hook storage and firing
from ``Session._drain_hooks`` to ``TransportDrainTracker.register_drain_hook``
/ ``run_drain_hooks``. These tests pin the close-ordering contract that the
post-Wave-0.5 code MUST preserve:

* Hooks fire in registration order (insertion-order dict invariant).
* A hook that raises does not block the rest from firing (other hooks still
  run; ``run_drain_hooks`` does not propagate the exception).
* No hooks ever registered → ``run_drain_hooks`` is a clean no-op.

The lifecycle-level "drain hooks run before transport teardown" assertion
lives in ``test_runtime_lifecycle.py::test_close_runs_drain_hooks_before_transport_teardown``
— this file is the unit-level contract on the tracker itself.
