"""Unit tests for :func:`classify_launch_failure` (browser-launch triage).

``launch_persistent_context`` can fail for reasons the user can act on, and
before issue #2004 only the *system-channel* browsers (``chrome`` / ``msedge``)
had a friendly branch — a bundled-Chromium launch failure fell through to a
bare ``raise`` and surfaced as ``Unexpected error: ... This may be a bug``.

The classifier is pure (message in, Rich-markup help or ``None`` out), so every
branch — including the Windows-only ``spawn UNKNOWN`` execution veto, which
cannot be reproduced on Linux/macOS — is testable on any host.
