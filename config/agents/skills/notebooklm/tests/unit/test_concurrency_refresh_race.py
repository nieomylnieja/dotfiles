"""Snapshot-invariant for the shared POST helper.

httpx merges the cookie jar into the outgoing ``httpx.Request`` synchronously
when ``Kernel.post`` opens the stream. ``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post``
materializes a ``RpcRequest`` from an auth snapshot before the middleware chain,
and the ``Kernel.post`` terminal refreshes that envelope if auth changed while
the request waited in the chain. Therefore, within a single terminal attempt
the entire ``(csrf, session_id, cookies)`` snapshot is atomic from a concurrent
coroutine standpoint: no other task can mutate state between the terminal
freshness check and the wire.

The POST lives in the shared authed transport path used by
``RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`` so chat can share the same transport pipeline.
The AST guard below follows the POST; the invariant still belongs at the
shared site.

The auth-snapshot lock hardened the invariant by:

- making ``AuthRefreshCoordinator.snapshot()`` ``async def`` and acquiring a dedicated
  ``_auth_snapshot_lock`` for the read, so the four scalar fields
  (``csrf_token``/``session_id``/``authuser``/``account_email``) are
  observed atomically with respect to ``refresh_auth``'s
  write-block; and
- refactoring ``RpcExecutor.build_url()`` to consume the resulting
  ``AuthSnapshot`` rather than reading ``self.auth`` LIVE — that
  prior live-read was the actual torn-read hazard, since it let a
  refresh's write to ``self.auth.session_id`` slip into the URL between
  snapshot capture and request build.

This file *locks* the invariant in four ways:

1. ``test_kernel_post_terminal_has_no_await_before_post_per_attempt`` —
   static AST guard against an ``await`` inside the terminal's ``try`` body
   before ``Kernel.post``. The freshness check lives before the try block
   and is guarded separately so the lock acquisition itself is not a
   regression.

2. ``test_build_url_does_not_read_self_auth`` — static AST guard
   against any ``self.auth.<field>`` attribute access in
   ``RpcExecutor.build_url``. The method MUST consume only its
   ``snapshot: AuthSnapshot`` parameter; reverting to ``self.auth``
   would silently un-do the atomicity fix.

3. ``test_concurrent_refresh_does_not_corrupt_inflight_rpc_request`` —
   runtime self-consistency. Drives concurrent ``refresh_auth`` against
   an in-flight ``rpc_call`` (both orderings) and asserts the captured
   ``httpx.Request`` is never observed with mixed-generation (csrf,
   session_id, cookies) state.

4. ``test_auth_refresh_rebuild_has_no_await_after_snapshot_capture`` —
   static guard on the auth-refresh retry rebuild: once the post-refresh
   snapshot has been captured, pairing ``context["auth_snapshot"]`` with
   the rebuilt envelope must remain synchronous. The terminal still owns
   the final before-wire freshness check because inner middlewares may
   await after this rebuild.
