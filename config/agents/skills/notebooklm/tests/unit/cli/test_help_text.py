"""Snapshot tests asserting CLI group docstrings list every registered subcommand.

This guardrail prevents help-text drift: when a new subcommand is added to a
``click.group()`` (e.g. ``source clean``, ``artifact suggestions``), the group's
``--help`` output must continue to enumerate it in the docstring "Commands:"
block. Without this test, contributors could silently land a new subcommand
that ``--help`` users would never discover from the group's overview.

Coverage scope: the three CLI groups whose docstrings explicitly list their
subcommands as a discoverability aid (``source``, ``artifact``, ``note``).
Other groups (including ``download``, whose commands are registry-generated)
rely on Click's auto-generated subcommand table and are not in scope here.

Hidden subcommands: none of the in-scope groups currently mark any subcommand
``hidden=True``. If a future contributor adds one, this test will require it
to be listed in the docstring too — adjust the comprehension to filter
``c.hidden`` or move the hidden command out of the scoped groups.
