"""Characterization net for the ``playwright_login`` render contract (#1391 PR-1).
This is the **refactor-invariant baseline** for the planned drain of
``cli/services/playwright_login.py`` from the ADR-0008 services-boundary
allowlist (#1391). It pins the *current* command-boundary render contract of
the ``notebooklm login`` (Playwright) and ``notebooklm auth refresh`` flows so
the later refactor (PR-2) — which inverts ``console.print`` / ``exit_with_code``
/ ``run_async`` into an injected ``LoginIO`` sink — can be diffed against green.
Why the command boundary, not the helpers
==========================================
PR-2 moves *where* the raise / render happens (out of ``validate`` /
``prepare`` and behind a service-local Protocol), but the ``login`` /
``auth refresh`` Click commands re-render byte-identically afterwards. Driving
the real commands through ``CliRunner().invoke`` and snapshotting
``result.output`` by **string equality** (not substring) plus
``result.exit_code`` therefore survives PR-2 unchanged — substring asserts
would silently pass even if the refactor dropped or reordered a line, and they
miss the two ``markup=False`` sites where Rich would otherwise eat ``[...]``
brackets.
Determinism (cross-OS)
======================
The snapshots must be byte-identical on the ubuntu / macos / windows test
matrix, so three host-dependent inputs are neutralised:
* **Console width** — Rich derives its width from the (absent) terminal, and the
  no-TTY fallback differs per OS, so a message that reflows at 80 columns on
  Linux wraps elsewhere on Windows. The :func:`_fixed_console_width` autouse
  fixture pins the shared console to a wide fixed width, removing all incidental
  mid-line reflow and leaving only the **authored** newlines in the source
  strings — which are the real render contract.
* **Filesystem paths** — every storage / browser-profile path is a short,
  synthetic, filesystem-free :func:`_fake_path` whose ``str`` is a fixed literal
  (no OS-specific separator, no real I/O).
* **Interpreter path** — ``sys.executable`` in the Chromium install-failure
  diagnostic is pinned to a fixed stub.
These tests assert **current** behaviour: they are green on ``origin/main``
with zero ``src/`` change and must stay green across PR-2.

    Rich derives its line width from the terminal, and under ``CliRunner`` (no

    on the 80-column value Linux/macOS use, so messages that would reflow at 80
    wrap at different points (a real divergence first seen on
    ``test_all_accounts_with_storage_conflicts``). Forcing a wide fixed width
    removes the *incidental* mid-line reflow entirely, leaving only the
    **authored** newlines in the source strings — which are the actual render
    contract. The single shared ``console`` instance is reused by the service,
    ``session_cmd`` and the error paths, so pinning its size once covers every
    render site while still writing through to ``CliRunner``'s captured stdout.
    Patching ``Console.size`` at the class level pins the dimensions observed by
    every shared console. The wide 400 keeps every rendered line on one physical
    row even after the ``- legacy_windows`` adjustment Rich applies on Windows,
