"""Resilient launcher for the NotebookLM MCP server in Claude Desktop.

Claude Desktop (and similar MCP hosts) often run with a *restricted* ``PATH``
that omits user-local install dirs, so ``uvx`` may not be discoverable via the
shell ``PATH`` alone. This launcher searches the common install locations before
falling back to ``PATH``, then execs::

    uvx --from "notebooklm-py[mcp]" notebooklm-mcp [<forwarded args>]

forwarding the host's stdin/stdout/stderr through cleanly. The stdio passthrough
is critical: the MCP host speaks JSON-RPC over the child's stdin/stdout, so this
launcher must never write its own bytes to stdout. Diagnostics go to STDERR
only, and a missing ``uvx`` exits non-zero with a clear message.

Bundled inside the ``.mcpb`` extension and invoked via ``manifest.json``::

    "command": "python3", "args": ["${__dirname}/run_server.py"]

The module exposes ``find_uvx`` / ``build_command`` / ``main`` as importable
functions so the bundle can be unit-tested without execing anything.
