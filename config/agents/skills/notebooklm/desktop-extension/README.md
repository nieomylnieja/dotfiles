# NotebookLM MCP — Claude Desktop extension (`.mcpb` / DXT)

This directory packages the [`notebooklm-py`](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py)
MCP server as a one-click [Claude Desktop extension](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions)
(`.mcpb`, formerly DXT). Installing the bundle wires the NotebookLM tools into
Claude Desktop without any manual JSON editing.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `manifest.json` | The extension manifest (name, version, server command). |
| `run_server.py` | A resilient launcher that locates `uvx` and runs `uvx --from "notebooklm-py[mcp]" notebooklm-mcp`, forwarding stdin/stdout/stderr for clean JSON-RPC. |

The launcher resolves the server from PyPI on demand via `uvx`, so there is no
vendored Python environment in the bundle — only the two files above.

## Prerequisites

1. **`uv` / `uvx`** — the launcher shells out to `uvx`:
   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
   `run_server.py` searches `PATH` plus the common install dirs
   (`~/.local/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
   `/snap/bin`, and the Windows equivalents), so a restricted host `PATH` is fine.

2. **Authenticate once** with your Google account:
   ```bash
   uvx --from "notebooklm-py[mcp]" notebooklm login
   ```
   This stores credentials under `~/.notebooklm/` for the active profile, which
   the server binds at startup.

## Install

- **Claude Desktop:** download `notebooklm-mcp.mcpb` from the
  [latest release](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/releases/latest)
  (under **Assets**), then double-click it — or *Settings → Extensions →
  Install Extension…* and pick the file. Restart Claude Desktop; the NotebookLM
  tools (e.g. `notebook_list`, `chat_ask`, `studio_generate`) appear in the tool
  picker.

  Each stable release attaches a prebuilt, version-matched bundle (built and
  uploaded by `.github/workflows/publish-mcpb.yml`), so there is nothing to
  build yourself. (Pre-releases don't ship a bundle — the launcher resolves the
  latest stable server from PyPI regardless.)

For other MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) that read a JSON config
instead of a `.mcpb`, use the CLI installer instead:

```bash
notebooklm mcp install claude-code   # or: cursor / windsurf / claude-desktop
```

## Build from source (contributors)

End users should download the prebuilt bundle from the release above. If you are
developing the extension itself, build it locally with the official
[`@anthropic-ai/mcpb`](https://github.com/anthropics/mcpb) CLI (formerly `dxt`):

```bash
# From the repository root:
npx @anthropic-ai/mcpb pack desktop-extension notebooklm-mcp.mcpb
```

This produces `notebooklm-mcp.mcpb`, a zip of `manifest.json` + `run_server.py` —
the same artifact the release workflow attaches.

> The CLI validates `manifest.json` against the DXT schema during `pack`. The
> repo's own `tests/unit/test_mcp_desktop_extension.py` asserts the manifest is
> valid JSON with the required keys, that its version tracks the package version,
> and that `run_server.py` builds the correct `uvx` command, so the bundle stays
> shippable.

## How the launcher passes through stdio

The MCP host talks to the server over **JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout**. `run_server.py`
therefore:

- prints **nothing** to stdout (diagnostics go to stderr only), and
- passes the host's `stdin`/`stdout`/`stderr` straight through to the child
  `uvx` process.

If `uvx` cannot be found, the launcher prints a clear install hint to **stderr**
and exits non-zero — it never contaminates the JSON-RPC channel.
