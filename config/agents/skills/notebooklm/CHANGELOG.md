# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added account-level notebook collections through `client.collections` and the
  `notebooklm collection` CLI group, including list, create, rename, membership,
  and delete operations.
- Expanded source discovery with status/type filters, strict exact counts, Drive
  health, original-file links, MIME information, word counts, and revision
  timestamps. MCP and REST URL batches now use a single batch-capable request.
- Added structured source documents and offset-aware citation data so callers can
  render readable source text and align citations with both answers and sources.
- Exposed more notebook, artifact, chat, and research metadata, including project
  state, chat follow-up suggestions, artifact content/state, research mode,
  timings, termination reasons, and discovered-source ordinals.
- Added standalone `notebooklm research import`, configurable research-import
  timeouts, bulk sharing grants with `SharingAPI.set_users()`, and sharing-policy
  and collaborator-limit fields.
- Added opt-in mid-session `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` support for long-running
  servers with `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_MIDSESSION=1`.

### Changed

- The default NotebookLM host is now `https://notebook.google.com`; the previous
  `https://notebooklm.google.com` host remains supported for existing setups.
- `Notebook.last_viewed_at` and `NotebookMetadata.last_viewed_at` now describe the
  backend timestamp accurately. The old `modified_at` names remain compatible
  aliases through v0.x.
- Deep-research CLI waits now default to 1,800 seconds instead of 300 seconds.
- **Compatibility note:** `QuizQuantity.MORE` now has its own wire value and no
  longer compares equal to `QuizQuantity.STANDARD`. Quiz and flashcard option
  inputs are also validated as enums.

### Deprecated

- Direct `AuthTokens` storage loading and cookie projections are deprecated in
  favor of managed `NotebookLMClient.from_storage()` lifecycles. They remain
  available through v0.x and are scheduled for removal in v1.0.
- The pre-profiles home-root storage layout is deprecated. Running any
  `notebooklm` command migrates it to `profiles/default/` automatically.
- `ChatReference.answer_start_char` / `answer_end_char` are deprecated aliases
  for `fragment_start_char` / `fragment_end_char`; the old names remain through
  v0.x.

### Fixed

- Improved authentication and login reliability across both NotebookLM hosts,
  including Chromium setup diagnostics, custom storage paths, expired-session
  recovery, cookie persistence, and long-running MCP/REST sessions.
- Prevented notebook and source create retries from adopting an older item,
  duplicating a committed item, or retrying when the idempotency probe itself
  could not establish a safe answer.
- File uploads now preserve partial-failure recovery details, report processing
  failures that never resolve, and warn when a mistyped file extension would be
  treated as pasted text.
- Corrected chat answer selection, conversation turn numbering, Unicode and
  multi-block citation offsets, full cited-text extraction, and source passage
  resolution.
- Corrected notebook ownership, not-found handling, empty-notebook decoding, and
  create results when the pre-create baseline is unavailable.
- Corrected artifact status decoding, generation rejection messages, quiz and
  flashcard option ordering, and audio downloads (`.m4a` / `audio/mp4` rather
  than `.mp3`).
- Research imports now tolerate the backend's known retry response, distinguish
  no-results and cancellation outcomes, and preserve typed failure reasons.
- Corrected PowerPoint and unknown source-status decoding, Drive-source
  idempotency, Markdown full-text formatting, table-cell rendering, and custom
  per-RPC timeout handling.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-03

The headline of 0.8.0 is **integrations**: NotebookLM is now reachable from AI
agents and HTTP clients through two new adapters built over the shared `_app/`
core (ADR-0021) — an **MCP server** and an experimental **single-tenant REST API
server** — plus a **remote MCP connector** you can self-host for **claude.ai**
(and Claude Desktop / Code / Cursor) behind a Cloudflare Tunnel or Tailscale
Funnel, gated by a single password.

0.8.0 also lands the **breaking half** of the ADR-0019 error contract (the
[#1346](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1346) umbrella):
"absence and refusal **raise**; only success and async-lifecycle state are
returned." Every flip previewed under `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS` in v0.7.0 is
now the default, and the preview flag — together with the dict-subscript /
get-returns-None / kwarg-alias deprecation machinery — has been **removed**
(#1365). See the [Upgrading to v0.8.0](docs/upgrading-to-0.8.0.md) guide and the
**Breaking** section below.

> **⚠ `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS` is gone.** It was the v0.7.0 forward-compat
> preview gate; its target behavior is now unconditional, so the flag is a no-op
> (setting it changes nothing). Remove it from your environment / CI config.

### Added

- **MCP file upload now records and can verify a SHA-256 of the uploaded bytes.**
  The `/files/ul` route computes the digest of exactly the received bytes and
  stores it in the completion record (`{source_id, name, size, mime, sha256}`),
  which `await_upload` surfaces. An optional `?sha256=<hex>` lets a client assert
  transit integrity — a mismatch returns a clean `400` before the source is added
  (the single-use token rolls back and stays retryable)
  ([#1889](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1889)).
- **MCP `await_upload` emits progress keepalives while it polls**, so an MCP host
  no longer treats a long upload wait as a stalled call (`ctx.report_progress` at
  start and on each ~2s tick; best-effort, and a no-op without a client progress
  token) ([#1889](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1889)).
- **MCP remote `studio_download` returns the report / data-table body inline**
  (bounded, alongside the signed link) so a remote host can read a generated
  report without a second fetch
  ([#1911](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1911)).
- **`studio_status` reports `media_ready`, `studio_download` reports
  `size_bytes`, and `studio_retry` raises an actionable error** when an artifact
  can't be retried, instead of a bare failure
  ([#1924](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1924)).
- **Deploy quick start for end users**: the shipped Compose defaults to the
  `:latest` image, and each release now attaches a version-baked
  `docker-compose.yml` + `env.example`
  ([#1904](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1904)).
- **`await_upload` — confirm a brokered file upload landed.** A new MCP tool that
  waits for a source created via the remote signed-URL upload flow to finish,
  returning the added source (`source_id` / name / size / mime) as soon as the
  browser POST completes — so an agent that brokered an upload can confirm the add
  without polling `source_list`. Accepts the upload URL, the `/u/<shortid>`
  short-link, or the bare token.
  ([#1889](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1889))
- **Experimental in-app upload widget (opt-in).** With
  `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_UPLOAD_WIDGET=1` on a remote HTTP deployment, `source_add_widget`
  renders a file picker *inline* in MCP-Apps hosts (claude.ai, ChatGPT) so a mobile
  user can pick and upload **one or more files** (up to 10) without leaving the
  chat — no browser round-trip. Enabling it auto-enables stateless HTTP (which
  MCP-Apps hosts require to fetch the `ui://` widget resource). It stays off the
  default tool surface / budgets unless enabled; the portable signed-link flow
  remains the fallback. See [ADR-0027](docs/adr/0027-mcp-app-upload-widget.md).
  ([#1891](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1891),
  [#1894](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1894))
- **`studio_download` `download_ready` now carries `filename` / `mime` /
  `size_bytes`.** The MCP download-ready payload previously returned only the
  local path, so an agent had to stat the file to learn what it got; the
  artifact's server filename, content type, and byte size now travel in the
  envelope. ([#1835](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1835))
- **Explicit per-state counts in the `source_wait` aggregate.** The wait
  aggregate now reports how many sources finished `ready` vs `error` vs still
  `pending` (rather than a single rolled-up status), so a caller waiting on a
  batch can see partial progress and act on the failures.
  ([#1834](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1834))
- **`notebooklm skill package` — Claude-uploadable skill archive** (#1856 item 2;
  the docs half landed in #1857). Builds a deterministic ZIP whose root contains
  the `notebooklm/SKILL.md` skill folder (version-stamped, frontmatter-first),
  ready for upload via Claude **Settings → Capabilities** in chat and **Claude
  Cowork** — the supported hand-off for sandboxed agent environments that
  cannot run `skill install` against a local directory. Supports
  `-o/--output` (file or directory), `--force` overwrite protection, and
  `--json` (success payload `{"path", "version", "entries", "size_bytes"}`;
  failures use the standard error envelope with codes `SKILL_SOURCE_MISSING` /
  `OUTPUT_EXISTS` / `WRITE_FAILED`). Release workflow now also attaches `notebooklm-skill.zip`
  to GitHub releases alongside the `.mcpb` bundle.
- **`AccountLimits.tier` — a correct account-tier signal, sourced from the
  authoritative quota block.** The v0.8.0 removal ([#1738]) dropped a tier that came
  from `GET_USER_TIER` (`FetchRecommendations`, a **promotions** endpoint) which could
  not tell free from paid. This adds `tier` read from `GET_USER_SETTINGS` limits[4] —
  the *same* block as `notebook_limit` / `source_limit`, so no extra RPC. It is an
  opaque enum key (not an ordinal): `1`=Free, `2`=Pro, `4`=Plus, `3`/`6`=Ultra
  (20 TB / 30 TB), `5`=Expanded (legacy); only `1` and `2` are live-confirmed. The
  MCP **and** REST `server_info(include_account=True)` account blocks now include a
  `tier` key. The removed `plan_name` label and the promotions RPC/`AccountTier` type
  stay gone. ([#1738](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1738))

- **Short-form video format** across the client, CLI, MCP, and REST
  ([#1805](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1805)). Video
  generation now takes a format selector so you can request a **short** video in
  addition to the default full-length one. The server ignores a custom style on
  the short format, so passing one is rejected up front rather than silently
  dropped ([#1805](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1805)
  follow-up).

- **MCP `source_add` gains in-channel bytes and add-and-wait modes**
  ([#1803](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1803),
  [#1807](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1807),
  [#1890](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1890)). Rather than
  separate `source_upload_bytes` / `source_add_and_wait` tools, both fold into
  `source_add`: `source_add(source_type="file", bytes_base64=…, filename=…)` adds a
  small file by sending its bytes directly through the tool call (for network-boxed
  agents that cannot reach the signed browser-upload URL), and
  `source_add(..., wait=True, timeout=…, interval=…)` composes the add with
  `source_wait` for single-source adds — returning the `source_wait` aggregate plus a
  top-level `source_id`. This keeps the MCP surface leaner (ADR-0025): one `source_add`
  verb with input modes, not three near-duplicate add tools (MCP tool surface 36 → 34,
  schema-char budget ratcheted down).

- **Compact roster mode for `source_list` and `studio_list`**
  ([#1806](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1806)) — a terser
  listing shape that fits more entries into an agent's context window.

- **MCP strict IDs-only mode + canonical-id echoes**
  ([#1808](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1808)). Opt into
  rejecting name-based refs and having tools echo the canonical id they resolved,
  so an agent can pin every subsequent call to an unambiguous id.

- **Near-miss candidates on failed name lookups**
  ([#1787](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1787)). When a
  notebook/source/note/artifact name doesn't resolve, the error now lists the
  closest matches instead of a bare not-found.

- **Experimental: MCP server** (#1484, opt-in via the `mcp` extra). A
  [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server exposing
  NotebookLM to MCP clients (Claude Desktop / Code, Cursor, Windsurf) as 34 tools
  across notebooks, sources, chat, notes, studio artifacts, and research — built
  as a transport-neutral sibling adapter over the `_app/` layer (ADR-0021), so it
  behaves identically to the equivalent `notebooklm` CLI command. Run it with the
  `notebooklm-mcp` console script (stdio by default, or loopback HTTP via
  `--transport http`); wire it into a client with `notebooklm mcp install
  <client>` or the one-click `.mcpb` desktop bundle. Notebook- and source-scoped
  tool arguments accept a **name or an id**; destructive tools require
  `confirm=true` (returning a `needs_confirmation` preview otherwise); long-running
  generation is non-blocking (`*_generate` returns a `task_id` to poll via
  `*_status`, then download). **The MCP tool surface is experimental and not
  covered by the library's semver guarantees** — names, parameters, and output
  shapes may change between releases. `pip install notebooklm-py` is unaffected:
  the server and its dependencies (`fastmcp`) arrive only with the `mcp` extra.
  See [docs/mcp-guide.md](docs/mcp-guide.md).

- **Experimental: remote MCP connector — self-host NotebookLM for claude.ai,
  Claude Desktop, and Cursor** (#1645, #1647). The MCP server now also runs as a
  **remote HTTP connector**, not just a local stdio process: `notebooklm-mcp --transport http`
  serves the same tools over HTTP behind a bearer token, and `deploy/` ships a
  one-command Docker stack (`make dev`) that exposes it through a **Cloudflare
  Tunnel** or a **Tailscale Funnel** — no public IP, no open port, no TLS cert to
  manage. For **claude.ai** (whose connector UI is OAuth-only and has no bearer
  field), the server can run its own tiny **OAuth authorization server gated by a
  single password** (`NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`) — no external IdP, no JWT
  template; registered clients and tokens persist across restarts. Opt-in and
  additive: leave the OAuth vars unset to stay bearer-only (Claude Code / Desktop
  unaffected). The server **fail-closed** refuses to start on a non-loopback bind
  with no auth, or on partial / weak / non-HTTPS OAuth config. Single-tenant,
  self-hosted, one container per Google account. **The remote-deployment surface
  is experimental and may change between releases.** See
  [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) and
  [docs/mcp-guide.md](docs/mcp-guide.md).

- **Experimental: single-tenant REST API server** (#1538, opt-in via the `server`
  extra; console script `notebooklm-server`). A FastAPI app exposing guarded
  `/v1` routes — notebooks, sources, chat, notes, studio artifacts, sharing, and
  research — over the same transport-neutral `_app/` core the CLI and MCP server
  use (ADR-0021), so behavior matches the equivalent CLI command. Loopback-bound
  by default, requires `NOTEBOOKLM_SERVER_TOKEN`, and refuses an unauthenticated
  non-loopback bind. Native multipart source upload and `FileResponse` artifact
  download (no signed-URL broker needed). Follow-up work closed the remaining
  REST↔MCP capability and hardening gaps (#1620 notes CRUD, #1767). **The REST
  surface is experimental and not covered by the library's semver guarantees.**
  `pip install notebooklm-py` is unaffected — FastAPI / uvicorn arrive only with
  the `server` extra. See
  [docs/installation.md#rest-api-server](docs/installation.md#rest-api-server).

- **Master-token headless auth** (#1638, #1640; ADR-0023; opt-in via the new
  `headless` extra). NotebookLM's browser cookies are short-lived, and until now
  the only way to re-acquire them was a human re-running `notebooklm login` in a
  browser — fatal for long-lived headless / CI / server use. A durable Google
  **master token** (minted once via `notebooklm login --master-token`, then stored
  `0600` beside the profile) can now **re-mint fresh web cookies on demand with no
  per-session browser**. Recovery is automatic: when a `master_token.json` is
  present, an expired session re-mints in-process as the final layer of the
  refresh ladder (single-flight, so concurrent RPCs coalesce one re-mint) instead
  of raising "run 'notebooklm login'". `notebooklm auth check` surfaces the
  master-token identity and `--master-token-refresh` re-mints on demand. This is
  the foundation that makes the remote MCP connector and unattended deployments
  viable. **Security:** the master token is a **full-account, long-lived**
  credential — store it like a password and prefer a dedicated / throwaway account
  for servers. It and its dependency (`gpsoauth`) arrive only with the `headless`
  extra. See [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md) and
  [docs/auth-cookie-lifecycle.md](docs/auth-cookie-lifecycle.md).

- **Source labels** (#1474). A new `client.labels` namespace and a `label` CLI
  command group bring NotebookLM's source-label (tag) feature to the client:
  list / create / rename / delete labels and assign or clear them on sources, then
  narrow a listing with `source list --label <name>` (the MCP `source_list` tool
  also gained a label filter). Additive new public surface across the Python API
  and CLI.

- **Suggested prompts** (#1612, #1616). New `client.chat.suggest_prompts(...)`
  returns model-generated starter prompts for a notebook (backed by the
  `GeneratePromptSuggestions` RPC), surfaced as a `notebooklm suggest-prompts` CLI
  command and, later, an MCP `suggest_prompts` tool (#1726). A `mode` selector
  targets the surface the suggestions are for (ask / audio / video / quiz /
  flashcards / …). Additive new public surface.

- **Opt-in `curl_cffi` browser-impersonation transport** (#1632). An alternative
  HTTP backend that mimics a real browser's TLS fingerprint, selected via
  `NOTEBOOKLM_TRANSPORT=curl_cffi` (requires the `curl_cffi` package), for
  environments where the default `httpx` transport is fingerprint-blocked. It sits
  behind the existing `async_client_factory` seam; the default transport is
  unchanged.

- **`--json` on every local CLI command** (#1643). The remaining local commands
  gained a `--json` flag — now enforced by a coverage guardrail — so any
  `notebooklm` command can emit machine-readable output for scripting and
  automation.

- **MCP soft-404 body-pattern detection.** The `source_wait` content-sanity check
  (#1698) now also flags a READY web page that sails past the thin-text threshold
  but whose short body matches a dead-link / error-page boilerplate phrase (e.g.
  "Whoops! broken link") — a soft-404 that ingests as a full-bodied 200. Body-only
  (titles are never scanned), gated to sub-2000-char bodies, advisory-only (never
  blocks), zero extra RPC (the body is already fetched). The batch
  `source_add(urls=[...])` now surfaces the same warning per synchronously-ready
  web-page item.
- **MCP artifact rename & delete tools.** Two new MCP tools close the artifact
  CRUD gap (the server previously exposed create + read only): `artifact_rename`
  (title-only update) and `artifact_delete` (destructive, two-step `confirm`).
  Both accept a notebook/artifact name **or** ID, cover every studio artifact
  type including both mind-map kinds — note-backed maps route through the note
  system, interactive maps and regular artifacts through the artifact RPC — over
  the shared kind-aware `_app.artifacts` cores the CLI already uses. The MCP tool
  surface is now **28 tools**.
- **Live-API e2e coverage for the MCP server and the CLI binary.** The nightly
  E2E job now installs `--extra mcp`, so the MCP/CLI layers run against the real
  NotebookLM API once per release instead of being silently `importorskip`-ped.
  New suites: per-domain MCP tool round-trips plus a 28-tool→test matrix
  (`tests/e2e/test_mcp.py`); the HTTP transport, bearer gate, `.well-known`
  discovery, and signed-URL upload/download routes driven in-process over
  `httpx.ASGITransport` (`tests/e2e/test_mcp_http.py`); live-only contract
  checks — the `source_ids` omitted-`==`-`[]`-`==`-all collapse (#1652),
  not-found resolution, destructive confirm-gating, and the MCP error shape
  (`tests/e2e/test_mcp_contracts.py`); and a CLI-binary `--json` smoke including
  stdout-purity on a live failure (`tests/e2e/test_cli_live.py`). A standalone
  `scripts/mcp_live_smoke.py` runs the upload+download round-trip against a
  deployed server (PASS/FAIL) to bootstrap the new per-release manual
  "MCP connector smoke" checklist in `docs/releasing.md`.
- **Remote MCP file upload & download** (ADR-0024). Over the remote (HTTP)
  connector — where the claude.ai browser can't carry the MCP credential and the
  JSON-RPC channel can't carry bytes — `source_add type=file` and
  `artifact_download` now broker a **short-lived HMAC-signed URL** served by the
  same container, and the browser does the byte transfer out-of-band (the
  established remote-MCP pattern; MCP has no native upload primitive and its
  native binary-Resource download is capped far below a podcast/video). Upload
  accepts a raw body over `POST`/`PUT` (a browser file-picker page **or** a
  code-execution-sandbox `curl`), bounded by a 200 MiB per-request cap and an
  in-flight-upload limit; download returns a clickable `resource_link`. Enabled
  by `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_PUBLIC_URL` (falls back to `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_BASE_URL`);
  unset → the two tools return a clear "not configured" error and the server
  still starts. **stdio (local) installs are unchanged** — they keep reading and
  writing real local paths. The REST `server` extra already supports native
  multipart upload + `FileResponse` download and is unaffected. See
  [docs/mcp-guide.md](docs/mcp-guide.md#file-upload--download-remote).
- **Retrieve the generation prompt behind an artifact** (#1571). New
  `client.artifacts.get_prompt(notebook_id, artifact_id)` returns the free-text
  prompt an artifact was generated from, and a matching `artifact get-prompt`
  CLI command prints it (with `--json`). Works for every studio artifact type —
  audio, report, video, quiz, flashcards, interactive mind map, infographic,
  slide deck, and data table — by reading the prompt already present in the
  `LIST_ARTIFACTS` response through the new `ArtifactRow.generation_prompt`
  accessor (no new RPC). Returns `None` for an artifact with no stored prompt
  (e.g. a note-backed mind map) and raises `ArtifactNotFoundError` for an
  unknown id. The transport-neutral `_app.artifacts.get_artifact_prompt` exposes
  the same behaviour to the MCP/HTTP adapters.
- **Custom prompt for interactive mind maps.** `instructions` is now sent for
  interactive (studio-artifact) mind maps, not just note-backed ones. The
  interactive `CREATE_ARTIFACT` payload carries the free-text prompt at the
  `[9][1][2]` slot of its options block — the same slot quizzes and flashcards
  use — and the NotebookLM server honors it for variant 4 (verified live: the
  prompt steers the generated node tree, and reads back via
  `artifacts.get_prompt`). Previously `client.mind_maps.generate(...,
  kind=INTERACTIVE, instructions=...)` and `notebooklm generate mind-map --kind
  interactive --instructions ...` silently dropped the prompt with a warning;
  both now apply it. The no-prompt request shape is unchanged. (Note-backed maps
  still pass `instructions` through `GENERATE_MIND_MAP`, but the server does not
  reliably act on them.)

- **Passive auth validation for unattended monitors** (#1569). New
  `notebooklm.auth.fetch_tokens_passive(...)` validates the cookies on disk with
  a strictly read-only token fetch — it never runs `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`,
  never fires the layer-1 keepalive rotation poke, and never writes
  `storage_state.json` (additive public symbol; the active
  `fetch_tokens_with_domains` is unchanged). `notebooklm auth check --test
  --passive` routes the token probe through it, so a systemd/cron health check
  can answer "do the cookies currently authenticate?" without mutating state,
  spawning a subprocess, or racing real work. The transport-neutral
  `run_auth_check(AuthCheckPlan(..., passive=True))` exposes the same probe to
  the MCP/HTTP adapters.

- **`notebooklm auth refresh --verify`** (#1569). After a refresh completes,
  runs the passive token probe to confirm the resulting cookies actually
  authenticate, exiting non-zero if they still redirect to sign-in. A successful
  refresh command alone does not prove the post-refresh cookies work — this is
  especially valuable with `--browser-cookies`, which rewrites the cookie jar
  but does not otherwise verify it.

- **macOS login recovery hint.** When the bundled-Chromium interactive login
  times out (`Login not detected within 5 minutes`), the message now suggests
  retrying with `notebooklm login --browser chrome` to reuse an already
  signed-in system Chrome session — which often detects immediately and sidesteps
  bundled-Chromium issues on macOS.

- **Layer-3 headless re-auth: `client.refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)`** (#1525,
  P2; P1 was #1512). When NotebookLM's first-party cookies are fully dead — the
  homepage GET 302s to the Google login page and neither token refresh (L1) nor
  `RotateCookies` rotation (L2) can help — a persisted browser profile may still
  hold a live Google SSO session that outlives `storage_state.json`. The new
  opt-in re-auth layer drives an unattended **headless** browser against that
  profile to silently re-mint cookies, then retries. It is **explicit by
  default**: `refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)` (additive keyword-only,
  defaults to `False`) triggers it on demand, and a *mid-RPC* auto-fire happens
  only when `NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1` is set — L3 **never** fires by
  default, so behavior with no opt-in and no profile is unchanged. Outcomes are
  typed and honest (re-minted / profile-session-also-dead / unavailable) and it
  never reports success on dead tokens. **SECURITY:** the persistent profile is
  an account-equivalent credential; L3 is **local-unattended-only** and must not
  be the auth path for a remote / hosted MCP server. It reuses the existing
  cookie-domain allowlist and never logs a captured cookie value.

- **`client.mind_maps.list_note_backed(notebook_id)`** — typed list of only
  the **note-backed** mind maps (every `kind` is `NOTE_BACKED`, `tree`
  populated, deleted rows excluded) via a single `GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS`
  RPC — no `LIST_ARTIFACTS`. Factored out of `mind_maps.list()` (which now
  builds on it) and used by the CLI `artifact delete` carve-out probe so the
  note-backed membership check is fully typed while keeping the historical
  single-RPC call set (recorded cassettes replay unchanged).

- **Schema-drift observability: `rpc_decode_errors` counter + chat drift canary**
  (#1492). Wire-schema drift is the stated #1 breakage class, but
  decode/drift failures (`DecodingError` / `UnknownRPCMethodError`) were
  invisible to metrics — they did not even reach the transport-leg
  `rpc_calls_failed` counter (the middleware chain wraps only the transport
  leg; decode happens after). `ClientMetricsSnapshot` now exposes a dedicated
  `rpc_decode_errors` counter (additive, defaults to `0`, appended at the end
  of the dataclass so existing positional construction is unaffected),
  incremented at the executor's response-decode boundary whenever a decoded
  response envelope is rejected as drift — both the wrapped shape-drift case
  (bad JSON / missing key-or-index) and a surfaced `DecodingError` /
  `UnknownRPCMethodError` from the envelope decoder. A decoded *semantic* error
  (rate-limit, not-found, auth) is not drift and does not bump the counter; a
  drift error recovered by refresh-and-retry is not counted. (Positional drift
  raised later by feature-layer `safe_index` navigation, after `rpc_call`
  returns, is not yet routed through this counter — a tracked follow-up.)
  Operators can now alert on "Google reshaped a response" distinctly from
  ordinary 5xx / network failures. Separately,
  `scripts/check_rpc_health.py` now probes the streamed-chat orchestration RPC
  `GenerateFreeFormStreamed` — a `PATH_NOT_METHOD` (`v1` URL) endpoint with no
  obfuscated method ID — by asserting a 200 plus a recognizable stream frame,
  closing the gap where the chat surface escaped the daily drift canary.

### Documentation

- **Per-tier quota & limit reference (`docs/quota-limits.md`).** A new reference
  documenting NotebookLM's published static plan limits — notebooks, sources,
  chats, and studio artifacts across consumer (5 tiers), Workspace (5 levels), and
  Enterprise — keyed to the `AccountLimits.tier` int, with evidence classes for the
  features Google leaves unquantified and a note that live per-account
  remaining/reset counters are not API-exposed. Distilled from the research in
  [#1825](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1825); cross-linked from
  the `tier` field, `rpc-reference.md`, `mcp-guide.md`, and `python-api.md`.
- **Sandboxed agents (Claude Cowork / headless).** Documented running
  `notebooklm-py` from Claude Cowork and similar no-display sandboxes in
  `SKILL.md` and `docs/installation.md`: per-session `pip install` bootstrap (no
  `[browser]` needed for queries — that extra is only for the interactive
  `login`, which runs on a host machine), and reusing a host-generated
  `storage_state.json` via the root `--storage` flag or `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`.
  ([#1856](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1856))


### Changed

- **MCP: the standalone `studio_get_prompt` tool was folded into `studio_list`**
  (net −1 tool, ADR-0025 tool-surface consolidation). Each artifact's
  `generation_prompt` (the free-text prompt it was generated from, `null` when it
  records none) now rides the default `studio_list` summary listing, and
  `studio_list(item=<artifact>)` returns it for a single artifact resolved by id or
  exact title (the unified cross-type Studio resolver, as `studio_delete` /
  `studio_rename` use — not the old artifact-scoped title-prefix resolver). The
  prompt is decoded from the same `LIST_ARTIFACTS` row the listing already fetches,
  so this adds no extra request. The CLI `notebooklm artifact get-prompt` command
  is unchanged.
  ([#1896](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1896))
- **The in-app upload widget's token pool gets a longer (1h) TTL.** The widget
  mints one single-use token per file up front but uploads them sequentially, so
  a later file in a large batch could hit an expired token mid-upload; the pool
  now uses `WIDGET_UPLOAD_TTL` instead of the 15-minute default. The single-use /
  signed-token model is unchanged
  ([#1894](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1894)).
- **MCP name refs resolve by unique title prefix** (#1786). Notebook, source,
  note, and artifact name arguments now match on a unique title *prefix*, not
  just an exact title, so an agent can address an entity by the shortest
  unambiguous fragment; an ambiguous prefix is a resolution error listing the
  candidates.

- **MCP research tools now accept the poll id under one name, `poll_task_id`.**
  `research_status`, `research_import`, and `research_cancel` previously took the
  value that `research_start` / `research_status` surface as `poll_task_id` under
  mismatched parameter names (`task_id` on status/import, `run_id` on cancel),
  forcing docstring warnings about which id goes where and inviting copy-paste
  mistakes. All three now accept it as `poll_task_id`, so the value pastes
  verbatim from one tool's output into the next. The old `task_id` / `run_id`
  names still work as **deprecated aliases** (removed in v0.9.0): passing one
  emits a `DeprecationWarning` and adds a `deprecation` note to the result;
  passing both names with different values is a validation error.
  ([#1789](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1789))

- **MCP `source_wait` now returns one unified per-source aggregate** (#1669).
  Both modes — waiting for a single `source` or for every source in the notebook
  — return the same shape: `{notebook_id, ok, ready, timed_out, failed,
  not_found}`. `ready` carries the sources that reached READY (with
  `kind`/`status_label` labels); the three error buckets carry
  `{source_id, error}` entries; `ok` is `true` iff all error buckets are empty.
  Previously the single-source mode returned `{status: ready|not_found|failed|
  timeout}` while the all-sources mode **threw on the first failure and discarded
  every source that had already become ready** — the all-sources mode now reports
  **partial progress** instead. (A `source` reference that does not resolve still
  raises NOT_FOUND before the wait — an input error, distinct from a resolved
  source the backend reports missing/failed/slow.)
- **Regenerable test baselines (Phase 1; contributor-facing, no public API
  change).** Frozen public-surface snapshots that were hand-typed copies of
  values the code already derives — `_FROZEN_TYPES_ALL` and
  `_UNGATED_PUBLIC_ALL_SNAPSHOT` in
  `tests/_guardrails/test_public_surface_manifest.py` — are now *derived*
  baselines committed under `tests/fixtures/baselines/` (`types_all.json`,
  `ungated_surface.json`) and registered in `tests/_baselines/registry.py`
  alongside the existing CLI contract. A single freeze test diffs each committed
  file against `derive()`; a dev-only `--update-baselines` pytest flag (wrapped by
  `python scripts/regen_baselines.py`) regenerates them. Adding a public symbol is
  now one regen command plus a reviewed diff instead of hand-editing several
  literals. CI never regenerates — it only diffs (the regen flag is refused under
  `CI`). The authored `_DOCUMENTED_PUBLIC_IMPORTS` (promised-import *intent*) and
  `_TOP_LEVEL_TYPE_EXPORTS` (fuzzy derivation) stay hand-curated. See
  [ADR-0022](docs/adr/0022-regenerable-baselines.md).
- **`notebooklm.rpc` public surface narrowed to the two documented power-user
  imports** (#1589). `notebooklm.rpc.__all__` now lists only `RPCMethod` and
  `resolve_rpc_id`; the ~47 other names it used to advertise (the batchexecute
  wire helpers `encode_rpc_request` / `decode_response` / `extract_rpc_result` /
  …, the endpoint URL constants and helpers, `safe_index`, and the enum /
  exception **re-exports** that remain public under their canonical names —
  most enums as `notebooklm.<X>` / `notebooklm.types.<X>`, the exceptions as
  `notebooklm.<X>` / `notebooklm.exceptions.<X>`, with `ArtifactStatus` /
  `artifact_status_to_str` `notebooklm.types`-only and `ArtifactTypeCode` having
  no public alias) are no longer part of the
  blessed, compat-gated public surface. This aligns the audited surface with
  `docs/stability.md`, which has always marked `notebooklm.rpc.*` internal. **Not
  a removal:** every name stays importable as `notebooklm.rpc.<name>` for
  back-compat — only the public-API *advertisement* shrank. New code should
  import the canonical public name (or `RPCMethod` / `resolve_rpc_id` for
  raw-RPC power use). See [docs/deprecations.md](docs/deprecations.md).

- **`notebooklm.auth` public surface narrowed (PR-1)** (#1592). `auth.__all__`
  drops 23 internal re-exports that only first-party `src`/tests imported (the
  cookie-snapshot/storage helpers `save_cookies_to_storage` / `snapshot_cookie_jar`
  / `CookieSnapshot*` / `CookieSaveResult` / `advance_cookie_snapshot_after_save`,
  the WIZ-extraction helpers `extract_csrf_from_html` / `extract_session_id_from_html`
  / `extract_wiz_field`, `authuser_query` / `format_authuser_value`,
  `load_httpx_cookies` / `normalize_cookie_map`, `ALLOWED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` /
  `MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES`, the env/URL constants `KEEPALIVE_ROTATE_URL` /
  `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_ENV` / `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_USE_SHELL_ENV` /
  `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE_ENV`, `load_auth_from_storage`, `fetch_tokens`,
  and `recover_psidts_in_memory`). These were migration leftovers from the
  `_auth/*` extraction (ADR-0003 → ADR-0014); `docs/stability.md` has always marked
  `notebooklm.auth.*` internal. **Not a removal:** every name stays importable as
  `notebooklm.auth.<name>` for back-compat — first-party code now imports them from
  their `notebooklm._auth.<sub>` home. The documented imports (`AuthTokens`,
  `convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state`, the cookie-domain constants) and the
  cohesive operations (`enumerate_accounts`, `fetch_tokens_with_domains`,
  `fetch_tokens_passive`, …) are unchanged. See
  [docs/deprecations.md](docs/deprecations.md).

### Removed

- **`SettingsAPI.get_account_tier()` and the `AccountTier` type** (BREAKING).
  `client.settings.get_account_tier()`, `notebooklm.AccountTier` /
  `notebooklm.types.AccountTier`, and the underlying `GET_USER_TIER` RPC are
  removed. The tier came from `FetchRecommendations`, a **promotions** endpoint,
  and was a promotion-eligibility signal that could not distinguish free from
  paid — both a free and a Pro account reported
  `NOTEBOOKLM_TIER_PRO_CONSUMER_USER`. Use `client.settings.get_account_limits()`
  (`AccountLimits.notebook_limit` / `source_limit`) for quota decisions instead.
  The MCP `server_info(include_account=True)` account block drops its `tier` and
  `plan_name` keys (now `{email, authuser, available, notebook_limit,
  source_limit, output_language}`). See
  [docs/deprecations.md](docs/deprecations.md).

### Fixed

- `notebooklm login --storage <path>` now gives each custom storage file an
  isolated persistent browser profile, with login, logout, `status --paths`,
  doctor's L3 readiness row, and L3 headless re-auth resolving the same
  storage-specific path. New explicit-storage browser directories carry an
  ownership marker: `login --fresh` refuses to recursively delete unowned
  sidecars and logout leaves them intact (and reports the preserved path).
  Canonical legacy and named-profile layouts remain managed even when selected
  through `--storage`. Very long storage filenames use a stable canonical-path hash to
  stay within filesystem component limits. Existing custom-storage browser
  sessions are not auto-migrated because the old shared profile cannot be safely
  attributed to a storage file or account. (#2026)
- `notebooklm login --master-token` now starts Playwright with the required Windows
  event-loop policy, avoiding a pre-browser `NotImplementedError` (#2011).
- `notebooklm login` now recognizes `notebook.google.com` as the personal app landing
  host after the Gemini Notebook rebrand, preventing successful browser sign-ins from
  timing out after five minutes. Enterprise and RPC base-host validation remain
  unchanged. (#2013)
- `server_info(include_account=True)` (MCP tool and the REST `GET /v1/server/info`
  route) now adds an `output_language_is_default` boolean to the account block. When
  the account has never set an explicit output language, `output_language` is `null`
  **and** `output_language_is_default` is `true`, signalling that the account uses
  NotebookLM's default language rather than a bare null that reads as
  missing/broken. A genuinely unparseable settings response still degrades to
  `available: false` (so it stays distinguishable from the unset-uses-default case).
- **Self-hosted MCP OAuth: switching the served account no longer resets the client
  registry.** OAuth-registered clients + issued tokens (`oauth_state.json`) were stored
  under the *served account's profile dir*, so pointing the server at a different profile
  silently orphaned every connected client (ChatGPT / claude.ai → "Client ID not found").
  The OAuth state is now **deployment-scoped**, keyed on `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_BASE_URL`
  (the OAuth issuer) at `<home>/oauth/<slug>.json` — independent of the served profile,
  and distinct per issuer so two servers on one host stay isolated. New
  `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_STATE_PATH` overrides the path; the Docker deploy mounts a
  dedicated `/data/oauth` volume (`NOTEBOOKLM_OAUTH_STATE_DIR`). Existing installs are
  migrated once on startup (the legacy profile-dir `oauth_state.json` is copied over, then
  renamed `.migrated` so it is never re-read). This deliberately reverses the profile-dir
  coupling introduced in #1765, and applies the deployment-vs-data separation that the
  proposed multi-profile server
  ([#1901](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1901)) builds on — without
  implementing it.
- **`source_add` now honors an explicit `title` for YouTube, Google Drive, and
  web-page imports.** These source types re-derive the display title server-side
  (from the video / Drive / page metadata), so a caller-supplied `title` was
  silently dropped. `SourcesAPI.add_url` (new optional `title=`) and
  `add_drive` now apply the requested title via a best-effort post-add
  `rename` — a rename failure is non-fatal (the added source is kept with its
  upstream title and a warning is logged). The MCP `source_add` tool flags a miss
  with `title_override_applied: false` + a `warning`
  ([#1960](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1960)).
- **Fresh conversations are no longer reported as follow-ups.** A null-conversation
  ask now checks whether the server-assigned current conversation has any turns
  before setting `AskResult.is_follow_up` ([#1973](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1973)).
- **MCP `source_add` bytes upload no longer defaults to a generic
  `upload.bin`.** Passing `bytes_base64` without an explicit `filename` used to
  spool the file as `upload.bin`, which NotebookLM rejected with an HTTP 400
  ("file type unsupported") even for plain text. The filename/extension is now
  seeded from the `title` and/or `mime_type` (falling back to `upload.bin` only
  when neither yields one), so a bytes upload succeeds without a caller-supplied
  filename ([#1955](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1955)).
- **Research import is now idempotent.** Re-importing a completed research task
  no longer duplicates its sources: `import_sources_with_verification` (and the
  MCP `research_import` tool that drives it) pre-filters requested sources whose
  URL already exists in the notebook on *every* attempt, not only on the
  timeout-retry path. A repeat import adds nothing and reports the skipped
  sources — the MCP result gains `newly_imported` / `already_present` (with the
  existing source ids) and a `status` of `already_imported`. Pass
  `allow_duplicate=True` (MCP) to force a re-add. Report / pasted-text entries
  have no dedupable URL and are unaffected
  ([#1961](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1961)).
- `chat.ask()` (and the `chat_ask` MCP tool / `AskResult`) now report
  `is_follow_up=True` when an implicit ask (no `conversation_id`) continues the
  notebook's existing current conversation, instead of always reporting `False`
  on the implicit path. A genuinely new (first-ever) conversation still reports
  `is_follow_up=False`
  ([#1965](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1965)).
- **A missing optional-dependency error now points at the right fix.** Reading a
  source with `output_format="markdown"` without the `markdownify` extra
  installed used to report the wrong remediation ("Check the auth profile /
  storage configuration.") because the missing-extra error was classified as a
  configuration error. It now raises a dedicated `MissingDependencyError`
  (classified as a new `DEPENDENCY` category) whose hint names the install
  command — e.g. `pip install 'notebooklm-py[markdown]'` — across the MCP
  (`DEPENDENCY` code) and REST (`dependency` / HTTP 500) surfaces
  ([#1959](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1959)).
- **MCP `notebook_describe(include_metadata=true)` no longer reports a source
  count that disagrees with its own `sources` list.** The exposed
  `metadata.notebook.sources_count` is now re-projected to the enumerated
  (id-bearing, deduped) source count instead of the raw unfiltered
  `GET_NOTEBOOK` row count, which could inflate it (e.g. 168 vs 50) and mislead
  autonomous agents on quota / completeness. Source enumeration
  (`source_list` / `metadata.sources`) also dedups duplicate id-bearing rows
  (research re-imports, ghost/probe echoes), keeping the first occurrence
  ([#1919](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1919)).
- **MCP `research_import` is safe for unattended use.** The tool now imports via
  the timeout-tolerant `import_sources_with_verification` (as the CLI does), so a
  deep-research import that times out is reconciled against what the server
  actually committed instead of failing as if nothing imported (hiding a large
  partial import). It also gained optional `cited_only` (import only the sources
  the report cites) and `max_sources` (cap the count imported, applied after
  `cited_only`) so one call can't silently blow a notebook to its source cap.
  ([#1920](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1920))
- **`source_add` batch mode isolates a per-URL failure** instead of aborting the
  whole batch: a bad URL now yields a per-item `SourceAddError` while the other
  sources in the same call still add, matching the tool's documented behavior
  ([#1905](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1905)).
- **MCP `studio_generate` for interactive mind maps** now normalizes its payload
  to the bare node tree and returns a terminal poll shape, fixing malformed
  generate requests and non-terminal status reports
  ([#1908](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1908),
  [#1914](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1914)).
- **MCP `research_cancel` distinguishes an already-cancelled run** and surfaces
  the raw status code instead of a generic failure
  ([#1922](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1922)).
- **Content-sanity flags bot-challenge / WAF interstitial pages**, so a source
  that fetched a challenge page instead of real content is reported rather than
  silently ingested as thin content
  ([#1929](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1929)).
- **`suggest_prompts` strips a leading list marker** from returned prompts, and
  `research_start` drops redundant ids from its result
  ([#1909](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1909)).
- **The MCP server warns at startup when the upload widget is enabled but
  stateless HTTP is disabled** (`FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP` explicitly falsey),
  which would silently stop the widget from rendering
  ([#1915](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1915)).
- **RPC failures no longer leak the obfuscated method id or raw status code into
  the client-facing message.** A null-result RPC error used to read
  `RPC LBwxtb returned null result with status code 9 (Failed precondition).
  Found IDs: [...]` — surfacing the obfuscated method id (the #1 breakage class,
  which changes whenever Google re-obfuscates a method) and the raw numeric gRPC
  code to agents/users through MCP, REST, and the CLI. The message is now a
  stable, human-readable `The server rejected this request (failed precondition).`
  (or `The server returned an empty result …` when no status is attached); the
  method id, status code, and found-id list remain on the exception attributes
  (`method_id` / `rpc_code` / `found_ids`) for logging and debugging.
  ([#1921](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1921),
  [#1931](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1931))
- **A blank `FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP` no longer crash-loops the remote MCP server.**
  The deploy compose passed the variable through as `${FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP:-}`,
  which injects an **empty string** when unset — and FastMCP's settings bool-parse
  it at import and raise, so a docker deploy that didn't set the var crash-looped.
  The compose passthrough is removed (the upload widget auto-enables stateless in
  code; a non-widget deploy stays stateful), and an import-time guard treats an
  empty/whitespace-only value as unset so a blank value from any source can't crash
  the server. ([#1898](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1898))
- **Upstream upload errors surface as a clean, redacted 4xx — not an opaque 500.**
  An unsupported file type (or other upstream rejection) during a remote
  `/files/ul` upload used to leak a raw `httpx.HTTPStatusError` as an unclassified
  500 with no CORS header — which a browser upload widget could only report as
  "Failed to fetch". Upload HTTP errors are now classified at the client layer
  (429 → rate-limit, 5xx → server, 401/403/3xx → auth, other 4xx → validation)
  into a redacted, CORS-carrying response, so the user sees the real reason. Fixes
  the REST/CLI `add_file` path too.
  ([#1892](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1892))
- **Upload-only Drive file types auto-route to the file-upload path.** Adding a
  Drive file whose type NotebookLM only accepts as an upload (not an add-by-URL)
  used to fail at the RPC; the add-from-Drive path now detects those types and
  routes them through the upload flow, and when a Drive add can't be recovered the
  error now names the file-upload path as the remedy instead of a generic failure.
  ([#1887](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1887),
  [#1885](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1885))
- **Loopback MCP HTTP transport rejects non-loopback `Host` headers.** The
  loopback-bound HTTP transport now refuses requests whose `Host` header is not a
  loopback name, closing a DNS-rebinding vector against a locally bound MCP server.
  ([#1876](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1876))
- **Null-conversation chat asks are serialized with explicit follow-ups.**
  Consecutive asks against a fresh (null) conversation could race the
  conversation-id assignment; they are now serialized and threaded as explicit
  follow-ups so each ask lands on the intended conversation.
  ([#1880](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1880))
- **Multi-source `source_wait` no longer polls O(N²).** Waiting on N sources took
  one snapshot per source per tick; the wait now reads a single notebook snapshot
  per tick and derives every source's state from it, and the overall wait duration
  is bounded. ([#1882](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1882))
- **Raised the streamed chat-response size cap.** Long answers were truncated at
  the previous streamed-response ceiling; the cap is raised so full responses come
  through. ([#1852](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1852))
- **Aggregate retry deadline threaded through the RPC path; OAuth `fsync`
  offloaded.** The aggregate retry now honors a single deadline across attempts
  instead of resetting per call, and the OAuth token `fsync` is moved off the event
  loop so it can't stall concurrent requests.
  ([#1881](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1881))
- **`studio_download` rejects an unknown `output_format` self-documentingly.** An
  invalid `output_format` now returns an error that lists the accepted formats
  instead of an opaque rejection.
  ([#1833](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1833))
- **MCP source waits stay JSON-first.** `source_wait` output is emitted as
  structured JSON rather than prose, matching the rest of the MCP source surface.
  ([#1830](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1830))
- **Deep-research null-start no longer leaks an internal method id.** A failed
  deep-research start surfaced the obfuscated RPC method id in the error; it is now
  hidden. ([#1851](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1851))
- **REST server resource-limit hardening.** Several bounds were added to the
  experimental REST server so a single client can't exhaust it: per-route JSON
  request-body size caps ([#1846](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1846)),
  route-group backpressure to cap concurrent in-flight requests
  ([#1847](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1847)), a bounded fanout
  for multi-source waits ([#1844](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1844)),
  a shared suggest-surface map so the suggest routes don't each rebuild it
  ([#1843](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1843)), and
  `PendingRegistry.drop()` now removes the stale FIFO tuple so the pending queue
  can't leak entries ([#1879](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1879)).
  Diagnostics endpoints also stay live when auth is stale instead of failing with
  the guarded routes ([#1845](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1845)),
  and the account block is fetched with a single `GET_USER_SETTINGS` call instead of
  two ([#1862](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1862)).
- **Artifact-generation validation footguns** ([#1874]). Three input-validation
  hardenings on the artifact surface: (A) the REST `POST /artifacts`
  (`ArtifactGenerate`) body now rejects unknown fields (`extra="forbid"`) with a
  422 instead of silently ignoring a typo (`{"stylee": …}`) and starting a default
  artifact; (B) `generate_report` now coerces/validates `report_format` at the
  boundary, raising a clear `ValidationError` (that names `source_ids`) instead of
  an opaque `TypeError` deep in the payload builder when a caller misplaces a
  positional `source_ids` list; (C) `export()` enforces exactly-one-of
  (`artifact_id`, `content`) instead of firing a meaningless no-op RPC when both
  default to `None`. **Breaking:** `export()`'s `content` is now **keyword-only** so
  its positional slots match `export_report` / `export_data_table` (title in slot
  3) — this fixes a silent title→content misbind; pass `content=…` explicitly.
  ([#1874](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1874))

- **MCP source tools no longer swallow fatal errors or fan out unbounded.** The MCP
  `source_add` batch and `source_wait` had drifted from the REST route's policy: a
  batch `source_add` caught *every* per-URL exception — so an expired auth / rate
  limit / upstream 5xx was reported as a per-item "error" inside a **success**
  envelope, hiding it from the agent; and multi-source `source_wait` spawned one
  poller per source with no concurrency limit. The shared policy (the batch/wait
  caps, the fatal-vs-isolate classifier, and the bounded multi-source wait pool) now
  lives in the transport-neutral `_app` core (`_app.source_batch` / `_app.source_wait`)
  and is used by **both** adapters, with a parity guardrail (`tests/_guardrails/
  test_source_policy_parity.py`) that prevents future drift. Behavior change: a fatal
  batch item now aborts the whole `source_add` call (so an agent can re-auth/retry),
  only per-URL 4xx-input failures isolate; `source_wait` now bounds concurrency at 8,
  caps the source count at 100 on **both** the explicit-subset and the omitted-`sources`
  wait-all path (enforced at one shared chokepoint so the adapters can't drift), caps
  timeout at 3600s, and rejects non-finite (`NaN`/`Infinity`) timeout/interval — all via
  a shared `_app` validator used by the REST route too. Per-URL SSRF/validation isolation
  is unchanged.
  ([#1871](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1871))
- **Direct-PDF-URL sources no longer show the raw URL as their title.** Adding a
  source whose URL points straight at a `.pdf` left the full request URL in the
  title slot (the server extracts `<title>` for HTML pages but not for a direct
  PDF link), while HTML sources got proper titles. A PDF source whose title is
  **exactly the source URL** (the server degradation — not a user-set title that
  merely resembles a URL) now falls back to the URL path basename — e.g.
  `https://host/papers/SomePaper.pdf` → `SomePaper` (query and fragment ignored;
  percent-encoding decoded; a URL whose basename has no `.pdf` extension, such as
  `…/download?file=x.pdf`, keeps the raw URL rather than a misleading `download`).
  Applied consistently across `source list`/get (`Source.from_row`) **and**
  `source fulltext` (`SourceContentRenderer`). No network I/O and no PDF
  dependency; PDF `/Title` metadata extraction is out of scope. Because the fix
  lives in the shared read paths it applies **retroactively** — a source added
  before this release displays the derived title on the next read, so callers
  that relied on `source delete-by-title "<the raw URL>"` should use the new
  basename (URL-add idempotency is unaffected — it keys off the source `url`, not
  title). ([#1850](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1850))
- **Drive-hosted PDFs no longer list as `google_spreadsheet`.** The backend
  returns type code `14` for both native Google Sheets and Drive-hosted PDFs,
  and Drive sources carry no URL, so the read paths (`source_list` /
  `GET_NOTEBOOK` **and** `source fulltext` / `source_read` / `GET_SOURCE`)
  mislabeled Drive PDFs as `kind="google_spreadsheet"`. `kind` now disambiguates
  code `14` by the source MIME (`metadata[19]` / `metadata[9][2]` from a live
  capture): `application/pdf` → `pdf`, while real Google Sheets
  (`application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`) are unchanged. This completes the
  read-path half of the fix started in #1831 (the add path).
  ([#1832](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1832))

- **Remote MCP connector: pin `fastmcp==3.4.2` so claude.ai can connect.**
  fastmcp 3.4.3 regressed the RFC 9728 protected-resource-metadata route
  (`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` started returning **404**), which
  dead-ends the claude.ai remote-connector OAuth discovery — the connector fails
  with *"Couldn't connect to the server."* Because the `mcp` extra previously
  allowed `fastmcp>=3.0,<4`, the published `0.8.0a2` Docker image floated to the
  broken 3.4.3 at build time even though the client code was unchanged. The
  `mcp` extra is now pinned to the last-good `fastmcp==3.4.2`; the pin will be
  lifted once a fixed fastmcp ships.

- **First-class human/mobile upload path in `upload_required`**
  ([#1801](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1801)). When a source
  add needs a browser upload, the `upload_required` response now surfaces the
  human/mobile hand-off path as a first-class option rather than burying it.

- **`server_info` and the profile probe report the resolved profile, not the
  raw active one** ([#1790](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1790)).
  The REST server's `server_info` and its startup profile probe now bind and
  report the profile that was actually resolved for the request.

- **The `.mcpb` desktop bundle now ships for pre-releases and launches the
  pinned pre-release.** The bundled launcher (`run_server.py`) always ran
  `uvx --from "notebooklm-py[mcp]"`, which resolves the latest *stable* server —
  so a pre-release bundle would have run the stable release, not the
  pre-release (which is why `publish-mcpb.yml` skipped pre-releases). The
  launcher now reads its version from the bundled `manifest.json` and, for a
  `vX.Y.ZaN` bundle, pins the exact version (`uvx --from
  "notebooklm-py[mcp]==X.Y.ZaN"` — the explicit `==` pin resolves the pre-release
  under uv's default resolver, without loosening transitive dependency
  resolution); stable bundles stay unpinned and track the latest stable server.
  `publish-mcpb.yml` now ships a bundle for pre-releases too.

- **`notebooklm doctor` no longer greenlights a session that is missing
  `__Secure-1PSIDTS`** (#1753). The auth check previously passed on `SID`
  presence alone, so a login that captured only half the Tier-1 cookie set — a
  common outcome on Windows, where Chrome 127+ App-Bound Encryption blocks
  `--browser-cookies` decryption and an automation-detected Playwright login can
  be served a session without the rotating token-binding cookie — reported "All
  checks passed" even though every real RPC then failed with `Missing required
  cookies: __Secure-1PSIDTS`. Doctor now emits a **warn** row (not a hard fail —
  the cookie legitimately rotates and can be re-minted at runtime, so a static
  offline probe must not false-negative a recoverable session) pointing at the
  Firefox `--browser-cookies` and `--master-token` workarounds. `auth check
  --test` already reported the real error and is unchanged. New
  [troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) section documents the Windows
  App-Bound Encryption limitation and its workarounds.

- **`notebooklm auth check` text mode now exits non-zero when an executed check
  fails, matching `--json` mode** (#1569). Previously the Rich-table renderer
  printed the failed checks but always exited `0`, so an unattended health check
  using `auth check --test` (without `--json`) silently treated expired auth as
  healthy — text and JSON modes had different process contracts. Both modes now
  exit `0` only when every *executed* check passes (skipped checks — e.g. the
  token fetch without `--test` — do not count as failures) and non-zero (`1`)
  otherwise. Behavioral fix to the CLI exit-code contract; no API change.

- **`Notebook.created_at` now reflects the true creation time instead of the
  last-modified time; `Notebook.modified_at` is newly exposed.** The notebook
  metadata block carries two timestamps — the creation instant at
  `data[5][8][0]` (pinned across edits) and the last-modified instant at
  `data[5][5][0]` (advances on every modification). `Notebook.from_api_response`
  read the *modified* slot (`data[5][5]`) and labeled it `created_at`, so the
  field — and everything built on it (`--json` output, `metadata` export, the
  `Created` table column) — silently reported the last edit time. `created_at`
  now reads the creation slot (`data[5][8]`), and the last-modified time is
  surfaced additively as `Notebook.modified_at` (new field, defaults to `None`,
  appended at the end so positional construction is unaffected; also added to
  `NotebookMetadata.to_dict()` and the notebook `--json` envelopes). This
  applies to both `notebooks.get()` and `notebooks.list()` (the homepage/recent
  feed), which share the decode path. No signature change — `created_at` keeps
  its type, only its source value is corrected — so this is a behavioral fix,
  not an API-compat break, and `modified_at` is purely additive.
- **Decoded `created_at` timestamps are now tz-aware UTC instead of naive
  host-local time** (#1519). The shared decoder `_datetime_from_timestamp`
  (backing `Notebook`/`Source`/`Artifact`/`MindMap.created_at`) called
  `datetime.fromtimestamp(value)` with no `tz`, producing a **naive** datetime in
  the host's local zone — so the same epoch surfaced as a different wall-time
  string per machine, and `created_at.isoformat()` / `--json` output, the
  `strftime` table cells, etc. mis-stated the absolute instant (a notebook
  created `13:40:05` UTC rendered as the offset-less `08:40:05` under
  `America/New_York`). It now returns `datetime.fromtimestamp(value, tz=utc)`:
  the value is tz-aware UTC and host-independent. `.timestamp()` round-trips
  unchanged, so internal sort/dedup/download ordering is provably unaffected —
  only the rendered string changes (now offset-aware, identical everywhere).
  This is the production sibling of the timezone slip pinned out of the #1511
  golden VCR test.
- **Artifact downloads re-validate every redirect hop against the trusted-host
  allowlist (SSRF-adjacent)** (#1521). Both download clients
  (`download_url` single + `download_urls_batch`) use
  `follow_redirects=True`, but the host-allowlist + HTTPS gate validated only
  the *initial* URL. A trusted Google URL whose `Location` pointed
  off-allowlist — a non-HTTPS hop, or a private/link-local host such as
  `169.254.169.254` / `localhost` — was followed and its body written to the
  caller's `output_path`, defeating the explicit allowlist. (Google session
  cookies were already not leaked to a non-Google redirect host — the stdlib
  cookie policy is domain-scoped — so this never exposed credentials; the
  residual harm was attacker-influenced bytes landing on the filesystem.) Both
  clients now attach an httpx `request` event hook that re-checks every hop's
  host + scheme **before the request is sent**, raising `ArtifactDownloadError`
  on the first off-allowlist or non-HTTPS hop so the untrusted host never
  receives a connection. Legitimate trusted→trusted redirects (Google
  signed-URL CDNs already on the allowlist) are unaffected. The host-allowlist
  check (`_is_trusted_download_host`) also no longer percent-decodes the host
  before matching: decoding created a parser differential where
  `evil%2egoogleapis.com` (`%2e`→`.`) was judged trusted while httpx connected
  to the raw, non-Google host — the guard now matches the exact host httpx
  connects to and rejects any host containing `%`.

- **`source delete` now honors exact-id-wins over prefix matching, in lockstep
  with `source get` / `rename` / `refresh`** (#1522). The delete-path resolver
  (`_app/source_mutations.resolve_source_for_delete`) built its prefix-match
  list and branched solely on `len(matches)` with no exact-id short-circuit, so
  `source delete abc` raised `AMBIGUOUS_ID` when a notebook held both `abc` and
  `abcdef` — even though the shared resolvers (`cli.resolve.resolve_partial_id_in_items`
  and its `_app` twin `_app.resolve.resolve_ref`) both return on an exact
  (case-insensitive) id match before evaluating prefixes, so the other verbs
  resolved the same input. The delete resolver now mirrors that Rule 3: a
  source whose id equals the input (case-insensitively) wins over any
  longer-id prefix match (and is not treated as a partial expansion, so no
  "Matched:" prose is emitted). Genuine prefix ambiguity (two strict prefixes,
  no exact match) and the not-found / title-instead-of-id paths are unchanged.
- **`Note.created_at` and note-backed `MindMap.created_at` are now populated**
  (#1529). Both fields were declared `datetime | None` but never filled in,
  even though the raw `GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS` / `CREATE_NOTE` responses carry
  the creation timestamp in the note metadata envelope at `row[1][2][2][0]` —
  the same slot the artifact path already decodes. `NoteRow` gains a
  `created_at_raw` / `created_at` property pair (mirroring `ArtifactRow`) that
  centralizes the descent behind named position constants, and every
  note-creation surface now reads it: `notes.list` / `notes.get`,
  `notes.create` (both the wrapped `[[id, …]]` and the flat
  `[id, …]` CREATE_NOTE response shapes), `chat.save_answer_as_note`, and the
  note-backed `mind_maps.list_note_backed` / `mind_maps.generate`.
  `Artifact.from_mind_map` was lifted to reuse the shared `NoteRow` extraction
  so the position knowledge lives in one place. Additive: absent / legacy
  rows still yield `None`; no signature change.
- **`profile` filesystem commands now surface a friendly error + exit 1
  instead of a raw traceback** (#1520). The `profile delete` (`shutil.rmtree`),
  `profile create` (directory materialization), `profile rename` (`os.rename`),
  and text-mode `profile list` paths performed their pure-filesystem operations
  unguarded, so an `OSError` — a half-deleted or locked profile directory, a
  read-only mount, or a browser-profile file held by AV/the browser on Windows
  — escaped `SectionedGroup.main` (which only catches `ClickException`/`Abort`)
  and printed a Python traceback. Each now mirrors `profile switch`'s existing
  `except OSError -> click.ClickException` idiom, yielding the documented
  friendly-message + exit-1 CLI contract. The `--json profile list` path keeps
  its existing `handle_errors` envelope (an unexpected `OSError` there stays the
  `UNEXPECTED_ERROR` / exit-2 contract automation relies on).
- **Runtime secret redaction now derives from one canonical registry, closing
  several credential-disclosure gaps** (#1517, #1518). The logging redaction
  cookie-name alternation in `_logging.py` was hand-enumerated and had drifted
  from the project's own cassette sanitizer: the session cookies `NID`,
  `LSOLH`, and `__Host-GAPS` (classified must-scrub by
  `tests/cassette_patterns.py`) were absent, so a bare `NID=g.a000-…` token —
  exactly what `_auth/refresh.py` logs at DEBUG from refresh-command
  stdout/stderr through the redacting logger — passed through `scrub_secrets`
  verbatim (#1517). Google API keys (`AIza…`) and any future `__Secure-*` /
  `__Host-*` cookie carrying an opaque (non-token-shaped) value were also not
  redacted at runtime. Separately, `UnknownRPCMethodError.data_at_failure` was
  spliced unscrubbed with `!r` into `__str__` / `__repr__` / tracebacks (a
  string splice that bypasses the logging `RedactingFilter`), unlike the
  sibling `raw_response` which was already scrubbed, so a credential-shaped
  indexed value leaked through every rendering regardless of `NOTEBOOKLM_DEBUG`
  (#1518). All are fixed by a single canonical runtime registry
  (`notebooklm._secrets`): `RUNTIME_SESSION_COOKIES` (the bare must-scrub cookie
  names the redaction alternation now derives from), `SECURE_HOST_UMBRELLA_PATTERNS`
  (`__Secure-*` / `__Host-*` prefix umbrellas whose name class spans the full
  RFC 6265 `token` charset — any future secure/host cookie name fails closed by
  construction), and `AUTH_TOKEN_SHAPE_PATTERNS` (carrier-agnostic
  `g.a000-` / `sidts-` / `ya29.` token catch-alls plus the `AIza…` Google
  API-key shape, ported from the cassette registry as defense in depth so a
  secret under an unknown carrier name still fails closed). `data_at_failure`
  (and the already-scrubbed `AuthExtractionError.payload_preview`) are routed
  through `scrub_secrets`, so all three additions cover the exception surfaces
  too. Every name-anchored value pattern (cookies, the `__Secure-*`/`__Host-*`
  umbrellas, and the `at=`/`csrf=`/`f.sid=`/`upload_id=`/OAuth/`Bearer` query +
  header forms) now also redacts an RFC 6265 / JSON **double-quoted** value
  (`SID="opaque"`, `f.sid="opaque"`): the value class excluded `"`, so a quoted
  value made the whole pattern miss and leaked verbatim — the optional
  surrounding quotes redact the inner value while preserving the quotes. A
  parity guardrail
  (`tests/_guardrails/test_runtime_secret_registry_parity.py`) asserts the
  runtime registry stays in lockstep with the cassette sanitizer on every axis:
  bare-cookie superset, secure/host umbrella coverage by construction, and
  regex-string equality of the credential-shape set — so a new must-scrub shape
  added to the cassette registry forces the runtime registry to keep up.
- **Playwright login: closing the browser during the final storage-state
  capture now shows the browser-closed help instead of a bug-report prompt**
  (#1514, deferred from the #1512 review). Every in-flow Playwright call in
  the login flow (page recovery, the navigation retry loop, the login wait,
  cookie-forcing) already mapped `TargetClosedError` to the friendly
  `BROWSER_CLOSED_HELP` text + exit 1, but a closure in the narrow window
  during the final `context.storage_state()` capture fell through the outer
  handler's bare `raise` and exited 2 ("Unexpected error … please report a
  bug"). The outer handler in `run_browser_capture` now recognizes
  TargetClosed and surfaces the same help + exit 1; every other unexpected
  failure keeps the exit-2 bug-report contract.
- **Playwright storage-state filter hardened against malformed cookie rows
  and exact-duplicate identities** (#1513, deferred from the #1512 review).
  `filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy` no longer crashes the whole
  persist when rookiepy / Playwright emits a malformed row: non-dict entries,
  cookies whose `domain` is not a str, and cookies whose `name` is not a
  non-empty str are skipped with one bounded `logger.warning` per row
  (`reprlib` preview) instead of raising in `.get` / `.lstrip`. It also
  dedups rows sharing an exact RFC 6265 identity `(name, domain, path)`
  (path normalized via `or "/"`, matching every loader): the last occurrence
  in capture order wins whole (fields are never merged), mirroring the
  persistence-merge rule in `save_cookies_to_storage` where the newer
  observation overwrites the stored row for the same key. Same-name rows on
  *different* domains or paths are all kept — cross-domain same-name
  resolution remains a load-time concern (the flat loaders rank by
  `_auth_domain_priority`); deduping by bare name at write time would starve
  the `(name, domain, path)`-keyed runtime loader
  (`build_httpx_cookies_from_storage`), which legitimately holds e.g. the
  per-product `OSID` cookie on `notebooklm.google.com` and
  `myaccount.google.com` as distinct jar entries.

- **Split-state PSIDTS recovery no longer writes a duplicate
  `__Secure-3PSIDTS` row to `storage_state.json`** (#1523). On the
  `--browser-cookies` path, when `__Secure-1PSIDTS` is missing/expired (so
  recovery fires) but a fresh `__Secure-3PSIDTS` is already in the source jar,
  Google's `RotateCookies` POST returns both rotated SIDTS cookies and the
  in-memory recovery append loop emitted a second `__Secure-3PSIDTS` (and a
  stale `__Secure-1PSIDTS` twin) entry with no analog in any real browser jar.
  Auth still worked (the row is deduped on load), but the on-disk artifact
  diverged from the true cookie set. `recover_psidts_in_memory` now keys the
  source jar by RFC 6265 identity `(name, domain, path)` (path normalized via
  `or "/"`, matching every loader) and overwrites the existing row in place
  with the rotated occurrence instead of appending — exactly one row per key,
  carrying the fresh value, mirroring the last-occurrence-wins dedup added to
  `filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy` in #1513.

- **`sources.add_text` no longer swallows typed transport errors into
  `SourceAddError`.** Its bare `except RPCError` wrapped *everything* —
  including the `RPCError` subclasses `RateLimitError`, `AuthError`, and
  `ServerError` — so callers could not catch a rate-limited `add_text` to
  back off via `retry_after` (or re-login on `AuthError`). It now re-raises
  the narrow transport types unwrapped before wrapping only the residual
  broad `RPCError`, matching the ADR-0019 catch ordering its siblings
  `add_url`/`add_drive` already follow. The rule is now *enforced*, not just
  documented: a new AST guardrail
  (`tests/_guardrails/test_error_contract_catch_ordering.py`) fails any
  `except RPCError` clause that wrap-and-raises a different exception class
  without a preceding narrow-transport re-raise clause in the same `try`
  (scope: `src/notebooklm/**` minus the `rpc/` protocol layer, where the
  transport subtree originates).

- **`notebooklm note create --json` no longer reports failure on every
  successful create.** It previously emitted `{"id": null, "created": false,
  "error": "Creation may have failed"}` for every note it successfully
  created: a leftover raw-shape decoder in the `_app` layer went dead when
  `notes.create` was typed to return a `Note` (it expected the retired
  raw-list RPC shape and yielded `None` for a typed `Note`). The bug was
  masked in the unit suite by stale raw-list mocks of `notes.create`. The CLI
  now emits the real note id with `"created": true`; facade failures
  propagate as exceptions through the standard CLI error handler instead of
  a soft-failure envelope.

- **14 positional-decode sites no longer fabricate wrong-but-valid values
  silently on wire drift.** Guarded single-level reads of decoded
  `batchexecute` payloads could swallow a Google reshape into a plausible
  default — an empty notebook / mind-map id, an empty share email, a deleted
  mind map leaking as live, a silently-empty chat history, a `LIST_NOTEBOOKS`
  wrapper mis-dispatch feeding garbage rows, an unvalidated source type code,
  and a note lookup flipping found → not-found. Per the #1485
  absence-vs-malformed policy, genuine absence (short rows, `None` slots,
  legitimately-empty containers) keeps its soft degrade, while
  present-but-malformed data is now loud: the chat conversation-history walk
  moved behind a new `ConversationTurnRow` adapter and raises
  `UnknownRPCMethodError` on a truthy non-list payload or turns container
  (malformed individual turn rows and unrecognized role codes are skipped
  with a DEBUG diagnostic); `notebooks.list()` raises `DecodingError` on an
  unrecognized payload shape; mind-map rows are decoded through `NoteRow`
  and WARN when a null content slot lacks the soft-delete sentinel;
  notebook-id, share-email, and source-type-code slots WARN with a bounded
  payload preview when present-but-wrong-type (keeping list parsing alive);
  and `notes.get_or_none` id matching reads through `NoteRow.id`. One
  behavior nuance: `SharedUser.email` is now always a `str` — a `None` email
  slot normalizes to `""` instead of leaking `None` through the `str`-typed
  field.
- **Chat citation-structure drift is no longer swallowed at DEBUG** (#1505
  continuity — the last named survivor of that drift-swallow class). A Google
  reshape of the streamed-chat citation structure previously degraded to
  "answers with no citations" via a blanket `except → logger.debug → []` in
  `parse_citations` — invisible, and it also discarded already-parsed
  citations. Per the absence-vs-malformed policy: genuine absence (no type
  block, short type block, `None`/empty citation slot — the routine "answer
  without citations" shapes on real traffic) stays completely silent; a
  truthy non-list where the citation *container* belongs (`first[4][3]`) is
  structural wire drift and raises `UnknownRPCMethodError` (matching the
  parser's existing `inner_data[0]` raise and `unwrap_conversation_turns`);
  a present-but-unusable individual citation row now logs at least one
  bounded WARNING and is skipped, so a good answer keeps its surviving
  citations. Surviving citations keep their **raw wire ordinal** as
  `citation_number` (a skipped row leaves a hole; with nothing skipped this
  equals the dense numbering always produced), so the answer's literal `[N]`
  markers never shift onto a different citation. Correspondingly,
  save-as-note's positional marker fallback (`references[N-1]`) now applies
  only when that positional reference carries no `citation_number`: a holed
  marker drops its anchor with a warning instead of anchoring the wrong
  chunk.

### Security

- **The loopback DNS-rebinding `Host` guard is no longer bypassed on a tokenless
  local bind.** The guard is skipped only when an external bind is opted into
  **and** authentication (bearer or OAuth) is configured — the
  `ALLOW_EXTERNAL_BIND` flag alone (e.g. set while `--host` stays at loopback) no
  longer disables it, closing a rebinding gap on an unauthenticated local server
  ([#1935](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1935)).

### Breaking

- **`sources` / `artifacts` / `notes` / `mind_maps` `.get()` raise on a miss**
  (#1247). A genuine miss now raises the matching `*NotFoundError`
  (`SourceNotFoundError` / `ArtifactNotFoundError` / `NoteNotFoundError` /
  `MindMapNotFoundError`) instead of returning `None` (and the v0.7.0
  `DeprecationWarning` is gone), matching `notebooks.get`. Return annotations
  narrow from `X | None` to `X`. Use the unchanged, warning-free `get_or_none()`
  for the sanctioned `None`-on-miss lookup, or wrap in `try/except *NotFoundError`.
- **Typed research / mind-map / guide returns are attribute-only** (#1251). The
  `MappingCompatMixin` dict-subscript bridge is removed from `ResearchTask` /
  `ResearchStart` / `MindMapResult` / `SourceGuide` / `ResearchSource`:
  `result["key"]` raises `TypeError`; `result.get(...)` / `.keys()` / `.items()` /
  `.values()` raise `AttributeError`; `"k" in result` / `iter(result)` /
  `len(result)` raise `TypeError`. Only attribute access (`result.status`,
  `guide.keywords`, …) and `to_public_dict()` survive. `ResearchStatus` stays a
  `str`-enum, so `status == "completed"` keeps working.
- **`research.wait_for_completion(interval=...)` removed** (#1254). The deprecated
  `interval=` keyword alias is gone (its v0.7.0 `DeprecationWarning` cycle is
  complete); passing it now raises the standard `TypeError` for an unexpected
  keyword. Use `initial_interval=` (same poll cadence).
- **`generate mind-map` defaults to interactive** (#1272). The CLI
  `notebooklm generate mind-map <nb>` (and `artifact`/`download` mind-map paths)
  now default `--kind` to `interactive` instead of the note-backed JSON map. Pass
  `--kind note-backed` to keep the note-backed behavior.
- **`sources.refresh()` / `chat.delete_conversation()` return `None`** (#1290).
  Both previously returned `True` on success (uninformative — any failure raised
  first); they now return `None` and their annotations change from `-> bool` to
  `-> None`. `chat.clear_cache(...)` is deliberately unchanged and stays `-> bool`
  (its bool is meaningful).
- **Synchronous generation-kickoff refusals raise** (#1342). `artifacts.generate_*`
  and `revise_slide` no longer swallow a `USER_DISPLAYABLE_ERROR` refusal into a
  `GenerationStatus(status="failed")` — they re-raise the underlying
  `RateLimitError` / `RPCError`. `_parse_generation_result` raises
  `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError` / `DecodingError` on a missing artifact id.
  `research.start` raises `DecodingError` on an empty / non-list payload or a
  falsey `task_id` (return type narrows from `ResearchStart | None` to
  `ResearchStart`). The public `artifacts.with_rate_limit_retry` helper retries
  only on a *raised* `RateLimitError` and re-raises on budget exhaustion (a
  returned rate-limited status is no longer a retry signal).
- **Derived-read / lister drift raises `DecodingError`** (#1344). A
  structurally-unrecognized RPC payload that previously collapsed to an empty
  value now raises `DecodingError`, so callers can distinguish a genuine miss from
  server-side shape drift: `sources.check_freshness()`, the note lister, and the
  artifact raw lister reject malformed-but-truthy payloads. Legitimate
  empty / stale shapes are unchanged.
- **Mutate-existing ops fail loud on a missing target** (#1362). `notes.update`
  preflights existence and raises `NoteNotFoundError` before firing the update
  RPC; `sources.rename(..., return_object=False)` and
  `artifacts.rename(..., return_object=False)` run the existence preflight on the
  `False` path and raise `SourceNotFoundError` / `ArtifactNotFoundError` on a miss.
  `return_object=False` still returns `None` on success.
- **`NotebooksAPI.share()` removed + research poll/wait raise on ambiguity**
  (#1363). The deprecated `client.notebooks.share()` is gone — use
  `client.sharing.set_public(...)` + `client.notebooks.get_share_url(...)`.
  `research.poll(task_id=None)` / `wait_for_completion(task_id=None)` now raise the
  new `AmbiguousResearchTaskError` when two or more tasks are in flight (instead of
  warning and guessing); with a single in-flight task they resolve it silently.
- **Removed `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS` and the deprecation machinery** (#1365).
  The forward-compat preview gate and the `warn_get_returns_none` /
  `deprecated_kwarg` / `MappingCompatMixin` deprecation helpers are deleted now
  that every break they previewed is the default. `warn_deprecated` and
  `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS` remain for future one-off deprecations.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-06-29

Maintenance patch on the 0.7.x line. Backports fixes from `main`
(cherry-picked ahead of the v0.8.0 breaking release).

### Fixed

- **Markdown (`.md`) uploads no longer fail on Python 3.10** (backport of
  #1628; fixes #1627). `mimetypes.guess_type` returns `None` for `.md` on
  Python 3.10 and on hosts without a populated `/etc/mime.types`, so the upload
  fell back to `application/octet-stream`; NotebookLM could not infer a parser
  and processing failed server-side (status=ERROR), surfacing as
  "Error uploading source" / `SourceProcessingError`. `.md`/`.markdown` are now
  pinned to `text/markdown` before the opaque fallback.
- **Clearer error when NotebookLM redirects to its region / anti-abuse access
  gate** (backport of #1630). A redirect to `notebooklm.google` is now
  classified and surfaced with an actionable message instead of an opaque
  failure.
- **Interactive `notebooklm login` no longer hangs 5 minutes and silently
  fails to save auth** (backport of #1700; fixes #1697). The login-success
  detector used Playwright's default `wait_until="load"`, but
  `notebooklm.google.com` is a streaming SPA that never fires the `load` event
  (`readyState` stays `interactive`), so the wait blocked until timeout even
  though sign-in had succeeded — printing "Login not detected within 5 minutes"
  and never writing `storage_state.json`. The initial navigation and the
  success detector now pass `wait_until="commit"` (the same level the existing
  cookie-forcing navigations already use), so login is detected as soon as the
  authenticated host is reached.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-18

Maintenance patch on the 0.7.x line. Backports fixes from `main`
(cherry-picked ahead of the v0.8.0 breaking release).

### Fixed

- **Video Overview visual-style values corrected to match the live Web UI**
  (#1594; backport of #1597). `VideoStyle` used stale numeric wire values, so
  several named styles (Whiteboard, Kawaii, Anime, Watercolor, Heritage,
  Paper-craft, Classic, Custom) serialized as the *wrong* style on the wire.
  Values now match live Web UI captures, and `CUSTOM` is encoded the Web-UI way
  (the style enum slot is omitted/defaulted and the custom visual-style prompt
  is appended). **Note:** this changes the integer values of `VideoStyle`
  members — code that passed the raw ints must update; passing the enum members
  (`VideoStyle.WHITEBOARD`, …) is unaffected.

- **Video (and other artifact) generation no longer fails immediately on
  cohorts that reject the legacy client-options shape** (#1594; backport of
  #1583). `CREATE_ARTIFACT` sent a minimal param-0 of `[2]`; the live web
  client sends the fuller capability envelope
  (`[2, null, null, [1, …, [1]], [[1, 4, 8, 2, 3, 6]]]`). On some accounts the
  backend began rejecting the short form for video generation specifically —
  the artifact was created and then immediately marked failed, while audio and
  infographic (which the backend still accepted) kept working. All artifact
  builders (audio, video, cinematic video, report, quiz, flashcards) now send
  the full envelope, matching the browser. The VCR body matcher normalizes the
  old and new client-options shapes so existing generation cassettes still
  replay.

- **`notebooks.create()` and `sources.add_url()` no longer fail on
  already-migrated cohorts** (#1548; backport of #1546). Google migrated the
  `CREATE_NOTEBOOK` (CCqFvf) and URL `ADD_SOURCE` (izAoDd) payloads to a nested
  wire shape during the gradual rollout: the flat trailing template block
  (`[2],[1]` for create; `[2],None,None` for url-add) collapsed into a nested
  `[2, None, None, [1, …, [1]]]` block, and the URL source spec gained a
  trailing `1`. Backends on already-migrated accounts began rejecting the old
  flat shape (`status=3` for create, `5`/`9` for add-source), while read paths
  were unaffected. Both payload builders now emit the nested shape, which is
  forward-compatible across migrated and un-migrated cohorts (verified live).
  Scope is limited to the create + add-url RPCs with exact Web-UI captures; the
  youtube/text/drive/file `ADD_SOURCE` variants are unchanged.

- **Empty notebook summary no longer raises `UnknownRPCMethodError`** (#1485).
  A brand-new, source-less notebook has no summary yet, so the `SUMMARIZE` RPC
  returns an absent/`None` payload. `notebooks.get_summary()` and
  `notebooks.get_description()` now treat that routine "no summary yet" state as
  an empty summary (`""`) instead of mis-classifying it as wire-schema drift.
  Genuinely-malformed payloads (a present-but-non-list `result[0]`, a scalar, or
  a string where a nested list is expected) still raise. `get_summary` now shares
  the `_extract_summary` descent with `get_description`, so both agree on every
  shape. As part of the fix, `safe_index` rejects a `str`/`bytes` value at an
  intermediate descent hop (it is indexable but never a valid container, so
  descending it would smuggle a single character past drift detection).
- **`download <type>` no longer exits 1 with no file written** (#1488). The
  download path listed artifacts twice — the executor listed to select the
  target, then each per-type download re-listed to re-find it by id — so the
  second `LIST_ARTIFACTS` could not replay against a single-interaction VCR
  cassette and aborted the download. The executor now lists once and threads
  the already-fetched rows into the download method (which skips its redundant
  second list); studio downloads also no longer trigger the note-backed
  mind-map sub-fetch they never needed. Live behavior is unchanged for direct
  `client.artifacts.download_*()` calls.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-06

Maintenance patch on the 0.7.x line. Backports two fixes from `main`
(cherry-picked ahead of the v0.8.0 breaking release).

### Fixed

- **Chat reads no longer time out on slow shared-notebook streams** (#1466,
  #1468). `client.chat.ask` now uses a chat-specific per-read HTTP timeout
  instead of inheriting the general client `timeout`, so shared notebooks that
  are slow to emit the first streamed byte stop raising spurious timeouts. A new
  optional `chat_timeout` keyword on `NotebookLMClient(...)` /
  `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` (and a matching `chat ask` CLI flag)
  tunes the window; it defaults to 180 s. **Behavior note:** chat reads now wait
  up to 180 s by default rather than inheriting the prior client timeout — pass
  `chat_timeout=None` to restore the old inherit-`timeout` behavior.
- **Dropped a misleading byte-count-mismatch WARNING from the chunked RPC
  parser** (#1469). The decoder no longer logs a spurious size-mismatch warning
  during normal chunked parsing.

### Added

- `chat_timeout` keyword argument on the client constructors and a corresponding
  `chat ask` CLI option (additive; defaults preserve existing call sites).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-04

### Highlights

- **v0.8.0 error-contract runway.** This release lands the *additive half* of a
  cross-SDK convergence on "absence and refusal **raise**; only success and
  async-lifecycle state are returned." You can adopt the forward-compatible form
  today and run on both 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 with no flag day:
  - **Test your code against 0.8.0 today** — set `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS=1` to
    opt your process into the v0.8.0 error contract (`get()` raises
    `*NotFoundError` on a miss, all dict-style access on the typed returns
    (`[...]`, `.get()`, `in`, `.keys()`, …) raises, and
    the deprecated `wait_for_completion(interval=...)` alias raises) **without
    changing default behavior**. Run your test suite with it on to find breakage
    before you upgrade. This is the "test-before-you-migrate" mechanism paired
    with the [Upgrading to v0.8.0](docs/upgrading-to-0.8.0.md) guide.
  - **`get_or_none()`** — a new, **silent** optional lookup on
    `sources` / `artifacts` / `notes` / `mind_maps` that returns the object or
    `None` and never warns. It is the sanctioned replacement for the now-soft
    `get()`-returns-`None` pattern.
  - **`get()` now warns on a miss** (still returns `None` this release) and will
    **raise** the typed `*NotFoundError` for its domain in v0.8.0 (#1247).
  - **Typed `*NotFoundError` per domain** — `NoteNotFoundError` /
    `MindMapNotFoundError` join the existing source / artifact / notebook errors,
    all catchable via the `NotFoundError` umbrella.
- **Breaking: `rename()` returns the renamed object; `delete()` returns `None`.**
  `rename()` now re-fetches and returns the live object (raising `*NotFoundError`
  on a missing target), and `delete()` returns `None` and is idempotent on an
  already-absent target. See **Breaking changes** below before upgrading.
- **Typed dataclass returns** for `research.poll` / `start` /
  `wait_for_completion`, `artifacts.generate_mind_map`, and `sources.get_guide`
  (`ResearchStatus`, `ResearchTask`, `ResearchSource`, `ResearchStart`,
  `MindMapResult`, `SourceGuide`) — attribute access instead of untyped dicts,
  with a backward-compatible read-only mapping bridge.
- **Unified `client.mind_maps` surface** over both backends (note-backed +
  interactive), plus **`client.artifacts.retry_failed()`** to retry a failed
  Studio artifact in place (and a matching `notebooklm artifact retry` command).

### Breaking changes

> **⚠ BREAKING — `rename()` returns the renamed object; `delete()` returns `None`.**
>
> These return-type changes ship **now, as a clean break with no deprecation
> runway**, because the old returns were never usable contracts a caller could
> depend on in good faith. (Contrast `get()`'s `None`-on-miss, which **is** a
> real, documented contract and keeps its full deprecation runway to v0.8.0 —
> see issue #1247. The coherent story: **reads/renames are missing-strict;
> deletes are absence-idempotent.**)
>
> **`rename()` → returns the renamed object, raises `*NotFoundError` on a
> missing target** (issues #1255, #1256):
>
> - `artifacts.rename` previously returned `None` **even on success** (an
>   unusable return); it now re-fetches and returns the renamed `Artifact`,
>   raising `ArtifactNotFoundError` when the target is absent.
> - `sources.rename` previously **fabricated** an unverified
>   `Source(id, title)` when the RPC echoed nothing (a silent-false-success
>   bug); it now prefers the `UPDATE_SOURCE` echo, falls back to an internal
>   fetch, returns the real `Source`, and raises `SourceNotFoundError` when the
>   target is absent. **The fabrication is gone.**
> - `notebooks.rename` already returned the re-fetched `Notebook` (the
>   reference behavior) — unchanged.
> - `mind_maps.rename` (both note-backed and interactive backings) now returns
>   the renamed `MindMap` and raises on a missing target.
> - **Error taxonomy:** only *genuine absence* (empty-payload / absent-from-list,
>   detected via a content/list lookup — **not** a transport 404) maps to a
>   `*NotFoundError`. Transport / `429` / `5xx` / auth errors propagate **as
>   themselves** and are never laundered into a synthetic `*NotFoundError`.
> - **Bulk opt-out:** every `rename()` accepts `return_object: bool = True`.
>   Pass `return_object=False` to skip the hydrate re-fetch and return `None`
>   (artifacts' re-fetch is a full `LIST_ARTIFACTS`, so bulk renamers that
>   ignore the return should opt out to avoid N extra list calls).
>
> **`delete()` → returns `None`, idempotent on a missing target** (issue #1211):
>
> - `notebooks` / `sources` / `artifacts` / `notes.delete` and
>   `notes.delete_mind_map` (and `mind_maps.delete`) previously returned a
>   hardcoded `True`; they now return `None`. The old `True` was a tautology
>   (never `False`), but `True → None` is a *real, observable* flip from truthy
>   to falsy:
>   ```python
>   # BEFORE (entered the block; delete always returned True)
>   if await client.sources.delete(nb_id, src_id):
>       ...  # this branch no longer runs — delete() now returns None (falsy)
>   ```
>   Drop the `if`; call `delete()` for its effect. Use `get()` first if you
>   need to assert existence.
> - **Idempotent:** deleting an already-absent target **succeeds** (returns
>   `None`); it does **not** raise `*NotFoundError`. This matches HTTP `DELETE`
>   idempotency and keeps retry/teardown loops clean. (The one exception is
>   `mind_maps.delete` *without* an explicit `kind`, which must list to pick
>   the right RPC family and so raises `ValueError` for an unknown id; pass
>   `kind=` to delete idempotently.)
> - **Real failures still raise:** `allow_null=True` tolerates only a null
>   *result*, not an RPC/HTTP error — a `403` / `5xx` / auth / transport
>   failure on delete still propagates. "Idempotent on missing" is not "swallow
>   all errors."

> **⚠ BREAKING — lapsed v0.6.0-targeted deprecations removed.**
>
> These deprecation shims advertised removal in v0.6.0, which has shipped, so
> they have now been removed. This is a pre-1.0 breaking change. See
> [`docs/deprecations.md`](docs/deprecations.md) "Removed in v0.7.0".
>
> - **Positional `wait` / `wait_timeout` on `SourcesAPI.add_url` / `add_text` /
>   `add_file` / `add_drive`** — these parameters are now **keyword-only**.
>   Passing them positionally raises `TypeError`.
>   ```python
>   # BEFORE (deprecated, emitted DeprecationWarning)
>   await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, url, True, 45.0)
>   # AFTER
>   await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, url, wait=True, wait_timeout=45.0)
>   ```
> - **`ArtifactsAPI.wait_for_completion(poll_interval=...)`** — the deprecated
>   `poll_interval` alias was removed; use `initial_interval=...` (same
>   cadence). Passing `poll_interval` raises `TypeError`.
>   ```python
>   # BEFORE
>   await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb_id, task_id, poll_interval=5.0)
>   # AFTER
>   await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb_id, task_id, initial_interval=5.0)
>   ```
> - **`NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0` soft-mode opt-out** — removed. Strict
>   decoding is now the only mode: schema-drift helpers (notably `safe_index`)
>   always raise `UnknownRPCMethodError` on shape drift instead of
>   warn-and-returning `None` / `[]`. The env var is now ignored (no-op).
>   Callers that previously relied on the soft fallback should handle
>   `UnknownRPCMethodError` (a subclass of `RPCError` / `DecodingError`).
> - **`NotesAPI.create_from_chat(...)`** — removed (deprecated since v0.5.0,
>   two MINOR cycles of warnings served; the documented removal target was
>   v0.7.0). It was a pure forwarder. Use `ChatAPI.save_answer_as_note(...)`,
>   the canonical citation-rich saved-from-chat method and data owner
>   (ADR-0013): `await client.chat.save_answer_as_note(nb_id, ask_result)`.
>   The now-unused `save_chat_answer` injection plumbing on `NotesAPI` was
>   removed with it.
>
> **Not removed:** `SourcesAPI.add_file(mime_type=...)` and
> `notebooklm source add --mime-type` (file sources) were **reassessed and
> kept** — `mime_type` was re-wired to set the resumable-upload content-type
> header (overriding filename-extension inference), so it is a supported
> parameter, not a dead shim. Its stale `DeprecationWarning` had already been
> removed; the documentation now reflects this.
>
> **Not removed:** awaiting `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` still works —
> its deprecation targets v1.0, not v0.6.0.

### Added

- `get_or_none()` — the sanctioned **silent** optional lookup, added to
  `client.sources` / `client.artifacts` / `client.notes` / `client.mind_maps`.
  It returns the entity (`Source` / `Artifact` / `Note` / `MindMap`) or `None`
  for a genuine absence and **never warns**, making it the drop-in migration
  target for the now-deprecated `get()`-returns-`None` pattern (see
  **Deprecated** below; issue #1247). Unlike `get()`, it does **not** swallow
  transport, auth, or decode faults — only a real "not found" yields `None`.
  ```python
  # Silent optional lookup (no DeprecationWarning):
  src = await client.sources.get_or_none(nb_id, source_id)
  if src is None:
      ...
  ```
  Additive (ADR-0019; issue #1247).
- `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS` opt-in preview flag — run the **v0.8.0 error
  contract** early to test forward-compatibility before the breaking flips ship
  (ADR-0019 / umbrella #1346). Default-off and **byte-identical** to current
  v0.7.0 behavior; when truthy (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`) the three warn-runways
  adopt their v0.8.0 raise-target: `sources.get` / `artifacts.get` /
  `notes.get` / `mind_maps.get` raise the matching `*NotFoundError` on a miss
  (#1247), the **whole** `MappingCompatMixin` mapping surface — `[...]`
  subscript plus the silent `get` / `keys` / `items` / `values` / `len` / `in` /
  `iter` shims — raises the exact error a bare dataclass would (#1251), and
  the deprecated `ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion(interval=...)` alias raises
  `TypeError` (#1254). Takes precedence over `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS`
  (a runway raises regardless of quiet). The four `get()` methods are now routed
  through a single `_lookup.resolve_get` bridge, eliminating the hand-duplicated
  warn-on-miss pattern. Helper: `notebooklm._deprecation.future_errors_enabled`.
  The flag now **also** previews the purely-behavioral v0.8.0 changes that have
  no warn-runway (#1405): the uninformative `bool` returns of `sources.refresh`
  and `chat.delete_conversation` become `None` (#1290); a synchronous generation
  refusal **raises** the decoder's `RateLimitError` / `RPCError` /
  `DecodingError` / `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError` instead of being swallowed
  into `GenerationStatus(status="failed")` / returned `None` — across
  `_call_generate`, `revise_slide`, `_parse_generation_result`, and
  `research.start` (#1342); and the mutate-existing ops `notes.update` and
  `sources`/`artifacts` `rename(return_object=False)` fail loud with a
  `*NotFoundError` on a missing target (#1362). These previews are runtime-only —
  **no public return annotation changes** until the v0.8.0 flip — so default-off
  stays byte-identical. Does **not** close #1247/#1251/#1254/#1290/#1342/#1362 —
  the runways and current behavior remain until the v0.8.0 flip. See
  `docs/deprecations.md`. Additive (issues #1346, #1405).
- `client.artifacts.retry_failed(notebook_id, artifact_id)` — retry a failed
  Studio artifact in place (the web UI "Retry" action), via the new
  `RETRY_ARTIFACT` (`Rytqqe`) RPC. The artifact is not deleted first and the
  same `artifact_id` is preserved, so existing `poll_status()` /
  `wait_for_completion()` flows keep working. Follows the ADR-0019 "async
  kickoff" contract: an accepted retry returns
  `GenerationStatus(status="in_progress")`, while a synchronous refusal
  (`USER_DISPLAYABLE_ERROR` — rate limit / quota / not-retryable) **raises** the
  underlying `RateLimitError` / `RPCError` rather than returning a
  `status="failed"` handle. New `notebooklm artifact retry <artifact_id>
  [--wait] [--json]` CLI command. Additive (issues #1319, #1346).
- `notebooklm.artifacts.with_rate_limit_retry` now also retries when the
  wrapped callable **raises** `RateLimitError` (backing off and re-raising once
  the retry budget is exhausted), so it can wrap the new `retry_failed`. The
  existing returned-rate-limited-`GenerationStatus` path (used by `generate_*`)
  is unchanged — this is a backward-compatible addition (issue #1319).
- New public exception types for the note and mind-map domains, mirroring the
  existing `SourceError` / `SourceNotFoundError` shape: `NoteError` +
  `NoteNotFoundError` and `MindMapError` + `MindMapNotFoundError`. Each
  `*NotFoundError` is a triple-base `(NotFoundError, RPCError, <Domain>Error)`,
  so it is catchable via the cross-domain `NotFoundError` umbrella, at
  transport-level `except RPCError` call sites, and at domain-level
  `except NoteError` / `except MindMapError` call sites. These are the
  prerequisite for the mind-map not-found work (ADR-0019; issues #1291, #1346).
  `MindMapNotFoundError` is now raised by the `mind_maps` mutation paths (see
  *Changed* below); `NoteNotFoundError` is not raised by any method yet.
- `ResearchStatus.NOT_FOUND` — a typed lifecycle sentinel for the
  poll-observed absence of a *specific* requested research task, distinct from
  `NO_RESEARCH` ("nothing in flight"). `research.poll(notebook_id, task_id=...)`
  now returns `ResearchTask.not_found(task_id)` (status `NOT_FOUND`, carrying
  the requested id) when a non-empty pinned `task_id` matches no in-flight task;
  the unfiltered `task_id=None` empty poll still returns `NO_RESEARCH`
  unchanged. Additive and non-breaking — the poll never raises for an absent
  task (ADR-0019 Rule 4; issues #1344, #1346).
- **Typed return values for the research / mind-map / source-guide methods.**
  `research.poll` / `research.start` / `research.wait_for_completion`,
  `artifacts.generate_mind_map`, and `sources.get_guide` now return typed
  dataclasses instead of untyped `dict[str, Any]`, with a new
  `ResearchStatus` str-enum for the status field. The new public types are
  exported from `notebooklm` and `notebooklm.types`:
  `ResearchStatus`, `ResearchTask`, `ResearchSource`, `ResearchStart`,
  `MindMapResult`, and `SourceGuide`.
  ```python
  from notebooklm import ResearchStatus

  result = await client.research.poll(nb_id)
  if result.status == ResearchStatus.COMPLETED:  # also == "completed"
      for source in result.sources:
          print(source.title, source.url)

  guide = await client.sources.get_guide(nb_id, src_id)
  print(guide.summary, guide.keywords)

  mind_map = await client.artifacts.generate_mind_map(nb_id)
  print(mind_map.note_id, mind_map.mind_map)
  ```
  This is **backward-compatible**: `ResearchStatus` is a `str` enum (so
  `status == "completed"` still holds), and the returned dataclasses keep
  working as read-only mappings — `result["status"]` / `result.get("status")`
  / `result.keys()` / `"status" in result` all still work (subscript emits a
  `DeprecationWarning`; see **Deprecated** below). The dict-subscript bridge is
  removed in v0.8.0.
- **`WaitTimeoutError` — one catchable base for every wait/poll timeout.** A
  new public exception (`notebooklm.WaitTimeoutError`) is the common base of
  `SourceTimeoutError`, `ArtifactTimeoutError` (and its
  `ArtifactPendingTimeoutError` / `ArtifactInProgressTimeoutError` subclasses),
  and the new `ResearchTimeoutError`, so a single `except WaitTimeoutError`
  clause catches a wait timeout from any domain. It mixes in the built-in
  `TimeoutError`, so this is **fully backward-compatible**: existing
  `except TimeoutError` clauses keep catching every wait timeout unchanged.
  ```python
  from notebooklm import WaitTimeoutError

  try:
      await client.sources.wait_until_ready(nb_id, src_id)
      await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb_id, task_id)
      await client.research.wait_for_completion(nb_id, research_task_id)
  except WaitTimeoutError:  # was three separate / inconsistent timeout types
      ...
  ```
- **`ResearchError` / `ResearchTimeoutError`.** The research domain gained a
  catchable base (`ResearchError`, mirroring `SourceError` / `ArtifactError`)
  and a domain timeout (`ResearchTimeoutError`). `ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion`
  previously raised the bare built-in `TimeoutError`; it now raises
  `ResearchTimeoutError`, a `WaitTimeoutError` (and therefore still a
  `TimeoutError`), exposing `notebook_id` / `task_id` / `timeout` /
  `timeout_seconds` / `last_status`. (`ResearchTaskMismatchError` stays a
  `ValidationError` — it is caller-input validation, not a wait timeout.)

### Changed / Deprecated

- `ArtifactTimeoutError` now declares its bases umbrella-first
  (`WaitTimeoutError, ArtifactError`), matching `SourceTimeoutError` and
  `ResearchTimeoutError`. This is a cosmetic reorder with no behavior change:
  `isinstance`/`except` against either base is unaffected.
- `client.mind_maps` mutation sites now raise `MindMapNotFoundError` instead of
  a bare `ValueError` on a missing target, so callers can `except NotFoundError`
  (or `except MindMapError`) uniformly across namespaces. `rename` (and the
  underlying note-backed `rename_mind_map`) raise it; `MindMapNotFoundError`
  multi-inherits `ValueError`'s sibling `NotFoundError`, **not** `ValueError`
  itself, so existing `except ValueError` rename callers must switch to
  `except NotFoundError` / `except MindMapNotFoundError`. `delete(kind=None)` is
  now **idempotent** — deleting an already-absent mind map returns `None` rather
  than raising (matching `sources`/`artifacts`/`notes` delete, and the
  `kind`-supplied path). `get_tree` returns `None` for a missing mind map (it is
  a derived read that does not police parent existence) — previously `kind=None`
  raised on an unknown id. Shape-drift in the interactive payload still raises
  `UnknownRPCMethodError` (ADR-0019; issues #1291, #1346).
- `client.mind_maps.generate(kind=MindMapKind.INTERACTIVE)` now raises
  `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError` (instead of a bare `ArtifactError`) when the
  `CREATE_ARTIFACT` call returns no artifact id — no generation task was
  created. **Non-breaking for `except ArtifactError`**:
  `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError` is a subclass of `ArtifactError`, so that
  catch still works. (It also multi-inherits `RPCError`, so a handler that does
  `except RPCError` *before* `except ArtifactError` will now take the `RPCError`
  branch — the same MRO the sibling `generate_*` / `retry_failed` null-create
  paths already produce.) This aligns the interactive async kickoff with that
  sibling null-create contract (ADR-0019 "async kickoff"; issue #1359).
- Documented two pre-existing `client.mind_maps` read semantics (docs-only, no
  behavior change): `list()` populates `MindMap.tree` only for note-backed
  entries — interactive entries carry `tree=None` ("not fetched", not "empty";
  call `get_tree(..., kind=MindMapKind.INTERACTIVE)` to fetch one); and the explicit
  `get_tree(..., kind=MindMapKind.INTERACTIVE)` path delegates absence detection to the RPC,
  so a missing id's value is server-dependent (returns `None` today) rather than
  enforced client-side (issues #1355, #1359).
- **`ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion(interval=...)` → `initial_interval=...`.**
  The research waiter's poll-cadence keyword is now `initial_interval`,
  matching `SourcesAPI.wait_until_ready` and
  `ArtifactsAPI.wait_for_completion`. The old `interval=` keyword still works
  as a **deprecated alias** (warns in 0.7.0, removed in v0.8.0): passing a
  non-default value emits a `DeprecationWarning` (suppressible with
  `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`), and passing both `interval` and
  `initial_interval` raises `TypeError`. Default-shape calls stay silent and
  the signature is otherwise unchanged, so the public-API compatibility audit
  stays clean. See [`docs/deprecations.md`](docs/deprecations.md) for the
  migration.

### Deprecated

> Every deprecation below is on a compatibility runway to **v0.8.0**. The
> consolidated [Upgrading to v0.8.0](docs/upgrading-to-0.8.0.md) guide is the
> single reference for moving your code across the boundary; set
> `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS=1` to exercise the v0.8.0 behavior in your tests
> today.

- **`client.mind_maps.get()` returning `None` for a missing mind map is now
  deprecated**, closing the runway gap that left `mind_maps` as the only
  #1247-cohort namespace without one. It now emits a `DeprecationWarning` on a
  miss while **still returning `None`** (behavior unchanged this release),
  matching `sources.get()` / `artifacts.get()` / `notes.get()`. In **v0.8.0** it
  will instead **raise** `MindMapNotFoundError`. Use `get_or_none()` for the
  sanctioned optional lookup (it stays silent), or migrate the `None`-check to a
  `try/except MindMapNotFoundError`. The warning fires only on a miss; suppress
  it with `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`. Tracking issue: #1247 (gap: #1358).
  See [`docs/deprecations.md`](docs/deprecations.md).
- **`sources.get()` / `artifacts.get()` / `notes.get()` returning `None` for a
  missing entity is deprecated.** These three methods now emit a
  `DeprecationWarning` on a miss while **still returning `None`** (behavior is
  unchanged this release). In **v0.8.0** they will instead **raise** the
  matching `*NotFoundError` (`SourceNotFoundError` / `ArtifactNotFoundError` /
  `NoteNotFoundError`), unifying the not-found contract with `notebooks.get()`,
  which already raises `NotebookNotFoundError`. Tracking issue: #1247.
  ```python
  # Migrate the None-check to a try/except before v0.8.0:
  # BEFORE (deprecated)
  src = await client.sources.get(nb_id, source_id)
  if src is None:
      ...
  # AFTER
  try:
      src = await client.sources.get(nb_id, source_id)
  except SourceNotFoundError:
      ...
  ```
  The warning fires only on a miss; successful lookups stay silent. Suppress it
  with `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`. See
  [`docs/deprecations.md`](docs/deprecations.md).
- **Dict-subscript access on the new typed research / mind-map / guide
  returns is deprecated.** Now that `research.poll` / `research.start` /
  `research.wait_for_completion`, `artifacts.generate_mind_map`, and
  `sources.get_guide` return typed dataclasses (see **Added**), the legacy
  `result["status"]` dict-subscript access emits a `DeprecationWarning` and
  will be **removed in v0.8.0**. Migrate to attribute access (`result.status`).
  The silent `result.get(...)` / `result.keys()` / `"x" in result` mapping
  shims also disappear in v0.8.0. Suppress the warning with
  `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`. See
  [`docs/deprecations.md`](docs/deprecations.md).
  ```python
  # BEFORE (still works in 0.7.0, warns on subscript)
  if result["status"] == "completed":
      sources = result["sources"]
  # AFTER
  if result.status == "completed":
      sources = result.sources
  ```

### Fixed

- **CLI now emits the `NOT_FOUND` error envelope for the `*NotFoundError`
  family from the centralized handler, instead of the generic
  `NOTEBOOKLM_ERROR`.** Any `NotebookNotFoundError` / `SourceNotFoundError` /
  `ArtifactNotFoundError` / `NoteNotFoundError` / `MindMapNotFoundError` that
  reaches `cli/error_handler.py` (e.g. `notebooks.get()` on a missing notebook,
  or a `rename` whose target was deleted mid-operation) now exits `1` with the
  typed `{"error": true, "code": "NOT_FOUND", ...}` JSON envelope carrying the
  missing resource id — matching the per-command `source` / `artifact` /
  `note get` convention (the documented CLI not-found contract since v0.5.0).
  The per-command `get` paths already used `get_or_none` and are unaffected.
  This also makes the `NOTEBOOKLM_FUTURE_ERRORS=1` preview faithful at the CLI
  boundary, pre-positioning it for the v0.8.0 `get()` → raise / mutate-existing
  fail-loud flips (issues #1364, #1247, #1362).
- **`Source.from_api_response` now reports the real processing `status`.** The
  `ADD_SOURCE` / rename parsing path previously never read the status block and
  always fell back to `SourceStatus.READY`, while `client.sources.list()` /
  `get()` and the source poller read the decoded status. Both parsers now
  funnel through a single `Source.from_row` construction site, so a `Source`
  produced from an add/rename response carries the same `status` (and `url` /
  `created_at`) as the listing path. The `Source.status` field annotation was
  also corrected from `int` to `SourceStatus` (still an `int`-compatible enum).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-29

### Breaking changes

> **⚠ BREAKING — exception hierarchy symmetry restored.**
>
> `SourceNotFoundError` and `ArtifactNotFoundError` now inherit from `RPCError`
> in addition to their respective domain bases (`SourceError`,
> `ArtifactError`), restoring symmetry with `NotebookNotFoundError` which has
> mixed in `RPCError` since the 0.5.x series. Combined with the new
> `NotFoundError` umbrella (see **Added** below), the class declarations are
> now:
>
> ```python
> class NotebookNotFoundError(NotFoundError, RPCError, NotebookError): ...
> class SourceNotFoundError(NotFoundError, RPCError, SourceError): ...        # new RPCError mixin in 0.6.0
> class ArtifactNotFoundError(NotFoundError, RPCError, ArtifactError): ...    # new RPCError mixin in 0.6.0
> ```
>
> **Migration.** Code that catches the broad `RPCError` *before* a more
> specific `SourceNotFoundError` / `ArtifactNotFoundError` clause now routes
> "not found" through the broad branch instead of falling through to the
> specific one. Reorder your `except` clauses so the more specific exceptions
> come first.
>
> The example below uses `client.sources.get_fulltext(...)`, which raises
> `SourceNotFoundError` for a missing source. (`client.sources.get(...)`
> returns `None` and does not raise, so it doesn't demonstrate the change.)
>
> ```python
> # BEFORE — in 0.5.x this layout worked: SourceNotFoundError was NOT an
> # RPCError, so it fell through the broad `except RPCError` to the specific
> # handler. In 0.6.0 the broad handler catches it first, leaving the
> # specific `except SourceNotFoundError` clause unreachable.
> try:
>     fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(notebook_id, source_id)
> except RPCError as e:        # ← in 0.6.0 this also catches SourceNotFoundError
>     handle_rpc_failure(e)
> except SourceNotFoundError:  # ← in 0.6.0 this branch becomes unreachable
>     handle_missing_source()
>
> # AFTER — put the specific exception first so the broad branch only sees
> # other RPC failures.
> try:
>     fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(notebook_id, source_id)
> except SourceNotFoundError:
>     handle_missing_source()
> except RPCError as e:
>     handle_rpc_failure(e)
> ```
>
> Code that catches `SourceNotFoundError` / `ArtifactNotFoundError` directly,
> or catches via the domain bases (`SourceError`, `ArtifactError`), or via the
> shared `NotebookLMError` base, continues to behave exactly as before. Only
> the `RPCError`-before-specific ordering is affected.
>
> `SourceNotFoundError.__init__` and `ArtifactNotFoundError.__init__` also
> now accept keyword-only `method_id` / `raw_response` parameters (forwarded
> to the `RPCError` parent), matching the `NotebookNotFoundError` signature.
> All positional call sites remain source-compatible.

- **`notebooklm source stale <ID>` now follows the standard CLI exit-code convention by default.** Exit `0` indicates the freshness check succeeded (regardless of whether the source is fresh or stale); exit `1` indicates an error. Previously the command used an inverted predicate (`0` = stale, `1` = fresh) so the shell idiom `if notebooklm source stale ID; then refresh; fi` worked naturally. **Migration:** scripts that depended on the inverted predicate can opt back into the legacy semantics with the new `--exit-on-stale` flag (`if notebooklm source stale --exit-on-stale ID; then refresh; fi`). Scripts written for the new default should branch on the JSON `stale`/`fresh` fields or stdout text. See [`docs/cli-exit-codes.md`](docs/cli-exit-codes.md#source-stale-exit-on-stale) for the full rationale + the new `Exit code semantics` summary.
- **`NotebookLMClient.rpc_call(...)` no longer accepts `source_path`, `_is_retry`, or `operation_variant`** — the three kwargs deprecated in v0.5.0 (`docs/deprecations.md`) were removed after one MINOR cycle. The public escape hatch's primary contract (`client.rpc_call(method, params)`) is unchanged and the default-shape call keeps working with no migration. Migration:
  - **Keyword callers**: drop the removed kwarg from the call. The previous default-shape behavior (`source_path="/"`, `_is_retry=False`, `operation_variant=None`) is now what every call gets unconditionally — `source_path` was a leaky internal seam, `_is_retry` was an internal retry-loop flag, and `operation_variant` is part of the mutating-RPC idempotency registry. Calls that genuinely needed a non-`"/"` `source_path` or a specific `operation_variant` were already on the wrong layer; build a typed method on a sub-client instead, or open an issue describing the workflow.
  - **Positional callers** (rare): the positional order of the remaining parameters is `(method, params, allow_null, *, disable_internal_retries=...)`, so a previously-positional `source_path` / `_is_retry` argument now binds to a different parameter slot. A pre-cut `client.rpc_call(method, params, "/", True)` (which passed `source_path="/"`, `allow_null=True`) becomes `client.rpc_call(method, params, allow_null=True)` after the cut — switch to keyword arguments for `allow_null` to avoid this footgun.
  - There is no public replacement for the removed internal-only kwargs (`_is_retry`, `operation_variant`); they were never part of the supported surface in the first place.
- **`source add --url` rejects internal hosts by default (SSRF guard).** `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, RFC-1918, and link-local URLs — and any non-`http(s)` scheme — are now refused before ingestion. **Migration:** pass the new `--allow-internal` flag to ingest an internal `http(s)` URL intentionally (the scheme allowlist still applies). Full detail in **Security** below ([#1114](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1114)).
- **`source` CLI `--json` output shape changed.** `source get --json` now emits the bare kind value (`"type": "url"`) instead of the leaked Python enum repr (`"type": "SourceType.URL"`), and `source fulltext --json` emits a fixed `{source_id, title, kind, content, url, char_count}` payload instead of a raw `asdict(SourceFulltext)` dump. **Migration:** `--json` consumers parsing `source get`'s `type` field, or relying on extra `fulltext` keys, must update. Full detail in **Fixed** below ([#1129](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1129)).
- **Post-parse CLI validation errors exit `1` (was `2`) and print a JSON envelope on stdout under `--json`.** For `download` flag conflicts, `generate` validation, `research wait --cited-only`, and `ask --new` + `--conversation-id`, a `--json` invocation now emits `{"error": true, "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", ...}` on stdout and exits `1` instead of Click's stderr usage text + exit `2`. Text-mode behavior is unchanged. **Migration:** automation parsing these `--json` failures should branch on exit `1` + the JSON body. Full detail in **Changed** below (ADR-0015; [#1112](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1112), [#1115](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1115), [#1117](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1117)).

### Added

- **`notebooklm source stale --exit-on-stale` flag** — opt-in back-compat for the legacy inverted-predicate exit codes (`0` = stale, `1` = fresh). The default behavior is now the standard CLI convention (see **Breaking changes** above); pass `--exit-on-stale` to keep `if notebooklm source stale --exit-on-stale ID; then refresh; fi` shell idioms working.
- **`Exit code semantics` summary section in [`docs/cli-exit-codes.md`](docs/cli-exit-codes.md#exit-code-semantics).** A normative one-line table — `0` = succeeded as documented, `1` = failed or queried target not found, `2` = Click parser-time error — backing the convention every command obeys outside the documented intentional exceptions. Cross-references the existing tables and [ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-json-envelope-contract-for-post-parse-click-exceptions.md).
- **`NotFoundError` cross-domain umbrella exception.** Catch `NotFoundError` to handle any "resource not found" case across notebooks, sources, and artifacts in one `except` clause — replacing `except (NotebookNotFoundError, SourceNotFoundError, ArtifactNotFoundError):`. `NotebookNotFoundError`, `SourceNotFoundError`, and `ArtifactNotFoundError` all inherit from `NotFoundError`. The umbrella itself is additive; the asymmetric inheritance noted on its original introduction has been resolved in the same release — all three subclasses also mix in `RPCError` (see **Breaking changes** above for the `except`-ordering migration).
- **`notebooklm notebook delete --json`** ([#1167](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1167)). `notebook delete` was the last delete command (and the only `list` / `create` / `metadata` sibling) without a JSON envelope — passing `--json` crashed with `No such option`. It now emits the typed success/cancel envelope, refuses to prompt in `--json` mode (requiring `--yes`, else a `VALIDATION_ERROR` envelope + exit `1`), and surfaces `context_cleared: true` when the deleted notebook was the active context ([#1193](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1193)).
- **`notebooklm skill install --dry-run` / `--no-clobber` / `--force`** ([#1109](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1109)). Project-scope installs now classify each target as create / up-to-date / overwrite. A target that would be overwritten with *different* content exits `1` and lists the conflicts unless `--force` (overwrite) or `--no-clobber` (skip differing, still create missing) is passed; `--dry-run` previews intended writes without touching disk. Writes go through an atomic temp-file + `os.replace` so a crash can't leave a partial `SKILL.md`. User scope keeps the historical always-overwrite behavior (the new flags error when paired with `--scope user`).
- **`GenerationStatus.is_removed` + `status="removed"`** ([#1168](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1168)). A delisted or quota-removed artifact now reports `status="removed"` (`is_removed=True`) instead of a synthesized `"failed"`, so callers can distinguish a transient list omission from a server-marked FAILED artifact. `is_failed` stays `False` for a removal; `is_rate_limited` still treats a quota-worded removal as retryable, and CLI exit behavior is unchanged ([#1195](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1195)).
- **Structured media-timeout diagnostics.** When an *accepted* media task (audio / video / cinematic-video / infographic / slide-deck) stays queued or running past the `--wait` / `wait_for_completion` budget, the artifact APIs now raise a typed timeout exception that preserves the last poll-status transition and media-not-ready metadata (also surfaced in `--json`) instead of a bare timeout ([#1094](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1094)).

### Changed

- **Media `--wait` default timeouts raised.** `generate audio --wait` now defaults to 1200 s ([#1140](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1140)) and the video / cinematic-video wait defaults were increased to match empirical generation durations ([#1088](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1088), [#1094](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1094)), so long generations no longer time out before the artifact is ready under default settings. `docs/` now documents the media wait budgets and the manual `artifact wait` recovery path.
- **`notebooklm doctor` exits `1` when any check fails** ([#1160](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1160)). It previously built `status: "fail"` entries but always exited `0`, so CI health checks, `set -e` scripts, and monitoring probes read a broken install as green. Overall health is now computed from the final check states (after any `--fix`) and the process exits `1` if any check still fails (warnings stay non-fatal). The exit happens after the payload/table is emitted, so machine-readable `--json` output is unaffected; `doctor` profile JSON errors are also now wrapped in the typed envelope ([#1179](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1179), [#1146](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1146)).
- **Post-parse CLI validation errors emit the typed JSON envelope under `--json`** ([ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-json-envelope-contract-for-post-parse-click-exceptions.md)). `download` flag conflicts (`--force` + `--no-clobber`, `--latest` + `--earliest`, `--all` + `--artifact`), `generate` validation (cinematic `--format` / `--style` conflicts, invalid `--language` / `NOTEBOOKLM_HL`), `research wait --cited-only` without `--import-all`, and `ask --new` + `--conversation-id` now route through `{"error": true, "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", ...}` on stdout and exit `1` under `--json`, instead of Click's parser bypassing the envelope to exit `2` with usage text on stderr. Text-mode behavior (usage text, exit `2`) is unchanged. Flagged under **Breaking changes** above for `--json` automation ([#1112](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1112), [#1115](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1115), [#1117](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1117)).

### Fixed

- **`notebooklm artifact delete <id> --json` now requires `--yes` before deleting** ([#1197](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1197)). Without `--yes`, the command emits the typed `VALIDATION_ERROR` envelope, includes `"deleted": false`, exits `1`, and leaves the artifact untouched, matching the other destructive delete commands.
- **HTML file uploads now fail client-side with a clear validation error** ([#1127](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1127)). `notebooklm source add ./article.html` and `client.sources.add_file(..., "article.html")` previously reached NotebookLM's upload endpoint as `text/html` and surfaced a cryptic upstream `400 Bad Request`. The upload pipeline now rejects `.html` / `.htm` / `.xhtml` / `.xht` / HTML MIME uploads before registering a source, with guidance to convert the page to `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf`.
- **`notebooklm source fulltext -o FILE` no longer silently overwrites existing files** ([#1173](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1173)). Existing output paths now auto-rename by default (`FILE` -> `FILE (2)`, etc.); pass `--force` to overwrite intentionally or `--no-clobber` to fail when the path already exists.
- **`sources.list()` raises on a malformed `GET_NOTEBOOK` response under strict-decode (the default)** ([#1159](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1159)). A drifted or error-enveloped response was previously folded into an empty list, so a sync script could conclude every source had vanished and re-add them all. The hand-rolled list-shape checks now honor `NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE` (logging the drift warning, then raising `RPCError`); a genuinely empty notebook (a `None` sources slot) still returns `[]`. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0` for the legacy warn-and-return-`[]` fallback ([#1178](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1178)).
- **`client.rpc_call(..., allow_null=True)` raises on method-ID drift and anti-bot walls** ([#1158](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1158)). The decoder gated its entire null-handling block behind `not allow_null`, so opt-in null callers (`CREATE_ARTIFACT`, `GENERATE_MIND_MAP`, `DELETE_SOURCE`, `GET_SUGGESTED_REPORTS`, …) silently received `None` when Google rotated a method ID or served a redirect / anti-bot page. An absent RPC ID (drift) and a body with no RPC frames (anti-bot wall) now always raise; only a present-but-`null` `wrb.fr` frame returns `None`. Null-result error messages now embed the discovered `found_ids` ([#1176](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1176)).
- **Auth-refresh replay no longer re-issues non-idempotent writes** ([#1157](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1157)). After a mid-flight auth error (HTTP 401/403, or an auth-shaped decoded `RPCError`) on a probe-then-create method (`CREATE_NOTEBOOK`, `CREATE_ARTIFACT`, `CREATE_NOTE`, `ADD_SOURCE`, `SHARE_NOTEBOOK`, `GENERATE_MIND_MAP`), the refresh-and-retry path could duplicate the resource, invite email, or generation quota when the error landed *after* the server committed the write. Both replay paths (the `AuthRefreshMiddleware` 401/403 leg and the `RpcExecutor` decode-time leg) now honor the effective `disable_internal_retries` classification and propagate the original auth error so the caller's probe-then-create wrapper can disambiguate a commit-lost write ([#1177](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1177)).
- **`client.notes.create` raises when `CREATE_NOTE` returns no usable note id** ([#1162](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1162)). It previously fell through to a success-shaped `Note(id="")` that was never finalized via `UPDATE_NOTE` or persisted server-side, so any later operation keyed on the empty id silently misbehaved. It now raises `RPCError`, matching the sibling `add_source` / `notebooks.create` paths ([#1186](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1186)).
- **Stale authed-POST envelope rebuilt after a `401 → refresh → 429 → retry` flow** ([#1096](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1096)). The terminal freshness guard's snapshot-equality short-circuit could POST the pre-refresh URL / headers / body against the refreshed cookie jar; the envelope is now rebuilt from a freshly captured auth snapshot on every terminal attempt (byte-identical on the happy path, load-bearing on the post-refresh retry).
- **`NotebookLMClient.close(drain=True)` no longer hangs on in-flight artifact polls** ([#1161](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1161)). Registered drain hooks (which cancel polls parked in `operation_scope`) now fire before the drain wait, so `close()` short-circuits a pending poll instead of blocking up to the poll's own 300 s timeout ([#1182](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1182)).
- **`Kernel.open()` closes the httpx client if the open-time cookie snapshot raises** ([#1163](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1163)). A failure while capturing the open snapshot previously propagated with a live, never-closed client (Python skips `__aexit__` after a failed `__aenter__`), leaking the connection pool. `open()` now `aclose()`s the partial client and resets it so a retry rebuilds cleanly ([#1187](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1187)).
- **RPC concurrency semaphore gains the loop-affinity guard + close→reopen reset its siblings already have** ([#1169](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1169)). The per-client `max_concurrent_rpcs` semaphore was the only loop-bound primitive without an affinity guard or reset, so reopening a capped client on a different event loop reused the stale semaphore and could raise "bound to a different event loop" or mispark waiters on Python 3.10/3.11 (masked on 3.12+). It is now guarded by the bound-loop assertion and discarded on any bound-loop change ([#1196](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1196)).
- **New conversations are serialized per notebook** ([#1144](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1144)). Concurrent `chat.ask()` calls with no `conversation_id` against the same notebook are serialized so they no longer race to create duplicate server-side conversations.
- **Auth-refresh lock released if the lock-wait metric raises** ([#1164](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1164)). `await_refresh` recorded the lock-wait metric between `acquire()` and the `try`, so a metric-side exception left the auth-refresh lock held forever, deadlocking every subsequent refresh. The metric call moved inside the `try` / `finally: release()`, matching the sibling `update_auth_tokens` ([#1188](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1188)).
- **Source-upload registration fails closed on an unparseable source id** ([#1143](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1143)). The resumable-upload path now raises instead of silently accepting a response it can't parse a source id from, while still tolerating the legacy filename-first row shapes.
- **Artifact-generation defaults and null responses hardened** ([#1063](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1063), [#1088](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1088)). Omitting infographic options on the Python `client.artifacts.generate_*` calls now sends concrete visual defaults (matching the CLI) instead of producing a null `CREATE_ARTIFACT` result, and a null artifact-generation response is now classified as `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError`.
- **`source` command `--json` output shape corrected and stabilized** ([#1129](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1129)). `source get --json` previously leaked the Python enum repr (`"type": "SourceType.URL"`) and now emits the bare kind value (`"type": "url"`); `source fulltext --json` now emits a fixed `{source_id, title, kind, content, url, char_count}` payload instead of a raw `asdict(SourceFulltext)` dump, and its `-o` envelope gains a `kind` field. **`--json` consumers that parsed `source get`'s `type` field or relied on extra `fulltext` keys must update** (flagged under **Breaking changes** above). Shared serializers keep the shape consistent across the source subcommands going forward.
- **`notebooklm source add -` (stdin) rejects a non-text `--type`.** Piping content from stdin with an explicit non-text source type now fails with a clear validation error instead of mis-routing the content.
- **`notebooklm agent show` routes errors to stderr** ([#1175](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1175)) so they no longer pollute stdout.
- **Auth-error classification hardened** ([#1142](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1142)) — empty RPC code labels no longer slip past the auth-error matcher.
- **Malformed `batchexecute` chunk records are now counted** ([#1141](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1141)) rather than silently dropped, so the `client.metrics` surface reflects partial-response drift.

### Removed

- `NotebookLMClient.rpc_call(source_path=...)`, `NotebookLMClient.rpc_call(_is_retry=...)`, `NotebookLMClient.rpc_call(operation_variant=...)` — see Breaking changes above. The corresponding `DeprecationWarning` emitters in `client.py` and the `tests/unit/test_rpc_call_public_surface.py` warning-surface tests were retired in the same change.

### Security

- **SSRF guard on `source add --url`** ([#1114](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1114)). The prefix-only `startswith(("http://", "https://"))` check was replaced with a structural `urlsplit` parse + scheme allowlist (`http` / `https` only) plus a private / loopback / link-local IP guard and a `localhost`-literal guard. **Behavior change:** `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, RFC-1918 hosts, and `http://169.254.169.254` are now rejected by default — pass the new `--allow-internal` flag to ingest an internal URL intentionally (the scheme allowlist still applies). DNS is never resolved at validation time. Flagged under **Breaking changes** above.
- **Resumable upload URLs validated and redacted** ([#1130](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1130)). The server-returned upload session / cancel URLs are validated before use and redacted in error and log output so a credentialed upload URL can't leak.
- **Artifact download allowlist validated by hostname** ([#1172](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1172)). Download host-allowlisting now parses the URL hostname structurally instead of matching a string prefix, closing a bypass where a crafted URL (including encoded-slash hosts, hardened further in [#1199](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1199)) could satisfy a prefix check while pointing at an untrusted host.
- **`httpx` / `urllib3` logs redacted for library consumers** ([#1166](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1166)). `configure_logging()` now attaches a logger-level `RedactingFilter` to the `httpx` and `urllib3` loggers at import, so a consumer who enables httpx DEBUG (e.g. `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)`) no longer sees the session id in `?f.sid=...` request lines. Pure defense-in-depth — no handler is added, so consumers who never enable those loggers see no behavior change ([#1191](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1191)).
- **Bare CSRF / session-id token values redacted in logs** ([#1165](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1165)). The scrubber now redacts bare `SNlM0e` (CSRF) and `FdrFJe` (session-id) `WIZ_global_data` markers, the `csrf=` form alias, and standalone `AF1_QpN-` CSRF tokens — credential-equivalent shapes that previously passed through `scrub_secrets()` unredacted ([#1189](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1189)).
- **Playwright login subprocess output sanitized** ([#1111](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1111)). `ensure_chromium_installed` now strips ANSI control sequences and redacts inherited environment-variable secret values (including JSON-nested leaves such as `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`) from captured subprocess stderr/stdout before surfacing install diagnostics (meta-audit G4).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-23

The first release after the v0.4.x auth cookie lifecycle series. Headline user-facing work: a top-to-bottom CLI UX overhaul (uniform `--json`, exit-code policy, shell completion, stdin pipes, SIGINT-resume), auth and cookie reliability hardening (inline PSIDTS cold-start recovery, fail-closed `notebooklm use`, concurrent-upload safety), and the v0.3-era deprecation removal cycle. **Read Breaking changes below before upgrading.**

### Breaking changes

Items that need attention when upgrading from 0.4.x. Full migration prose lives in the natural sections below.

- **`NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE` now defaults to `1`** — RPC shape drift raises `UnknownRPCMethodError` (subclass of `RPCError`) at the decoder boundary instead of warning and returning `None`. Set `=0` to opt back into the legacy behavior for one release window (the soft-mode fallback itself now emits `DeprecationWarning` and is scheduled for removal in v0.6.0).
- **`rate_limit_max_retries` default raised from `0` to `3`** with exponential-backoff fallback. Programmatic users now inherit smart-retry behavior matching the CLI. Pass `rate_limit_max_retries=0` to restore the previous immediate-`RateLimitError` behavior. Mutating create RPCs already opt out via `disable_internal_retries=True`.
- **`server_error_max_retries` default raised from `0` to `3`** with the same exponential-backoff fallback, covering HTTP 5xx + retryable network errors (#629). Pass `server_error_max_retries=0` to restore immediate failure on 5xx.
- **`max_concurrent_rpcs` semaphore added with default `16`** (#630). High-fan-out callers (e.g. `asyncio.gather` over 100 RPCs) are now throttled by default instead of saturating the connection pool. Pass `max_concurrent_rpcs=None` to restore unbounded fan-out. Must satisfy `max_concurrent_rpcs <= ConnectionLimits.max_connections`.
- **`notebooklm use <id>` fails closed when the notebook doesn't exist.** `use` now verifies the id with `NotebooksAPI.get(id)` before persisting and exits `1` without writing to `context.json` on a missing notebook / wire failure / auth-expiry. Pass `--force` to bypass verification. `NotebookNotFoundError` now inherits from both `RPCError` and `NotebookError`.
- **`source get` / `artifact get` / `note get` exit `1` on not-found (was `0`).** Matches the rest of the CLI's user-error convention so scripts can branch on the exit code. `--json` failure body uses the standard `{"error": true, "code": "NOT_FOUND", ...}` envelope.
- **`generate cinematic-video --format <non-cinematic>` exits `2` with a UsageError** instead of silently overriding the conflict. Drop the conflicting flag, or use `generate video --format <value>` if a non-cinematic format was intended.
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` defaults to `shell=False`** (security hardening for the shell-injection footgun when the env var is sourced from CI configs). Now parsed with `shlex.split` and invoked with `subprocess.run(argv, shell=False, ...)`. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_USE_SHELL=1` (literal `"1"` only) to opt back into the legacy `shell=True`.
- **`source add` no longer follows symlinks by default.** A workspace symlink like `~/Downloads/foo.pdf → /etc/passwd` previously resolved and uploaded the target with no warning. The path now refuses symlink traversal with a `ClickException` (exit `1`) unless `--follow-symlinks` is explicit. Scripts that point at symlink-resolved paths must add the flag (#476).
- **YouTube cookies no longer scraped or trusted by default at login / refresh.** The cookie-domain allowlist split into REQUIRED (NotebookLM + Drive + RotateCookies) and OPTIONAL (YouTube / Docs / Mail / myaccount). Pass `--include-domains=youtube` (or `=all`) on `login` / `auth refresh --browser-cookies <browser>` / `auth inspect` to opt YouTube back in; pass `=docs`/`=mail`/`=myaccount` to opt those sibling domains in explicitly (#483).
- **Artifact generation without `language=` now honors the configured language.** The Python `client.artifacts.generate_*` methods now resolve omitted `language` via `NOTEBOOKLM_HL` / global config / `"en"` instead of hard-coding `"en"` at the signature. Pass `language="en"` for a fixed English payload.
- **`--storage <path>` no longer shares the default profile's notebook context.** A previously-run `notebooklm use <id>` against the default profile is invisible to a later `notebooklm --storage X.json <cmd>` (and vice versa) because `--storage` now derives a sibling `<path>.context.json`. Set the active notebook explicitly via `notebooklm --storage <path> use <id>`, `-n/--notebook`, or `NOTEBOOKLM_NOTEBOOK` env var (#467).
- **`login --browser-cookies --account EMAIL` now writes the active/default profile by default** instead of creating a profile from the email local-part. Use `--profile-name NAME` to write a separate named profile, or `--storage PATH` for an exact file. Existing profile auth for a different or unknown account prompts before overwrite (#987).
- **v0.3-era deprecated APIs removed** — `Source.source_type`, `Artifact.artifact_type`, `Artifact.variant`, `SourceFulltext.source_type`, `StudioContentType`, `DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH`, `notebooklm.cli.language.save_config`. Migrate to the `.kind` property and `notebooklm.paths.get_storage_path()`. See **Removed** below.
- **Cookie identity widened to `(name, domain, path)`** per RFC 6265 §5.3. Writes remain backward-compatible (flat dicts / legacy 2-tuples still accepted); reads of `auth.cookies` with the old 2-tuple key now raise `KeyError`. Use `auth.cookies[("SID", ".google.com", "/")]`, `auth.flat_cookies["SID"]`, or `auth.cookie_header`.

### Added

#### Auth and reliability
- **Inline `__Secure-1PSIDTS` cold-start recovery.** When a storage file has `__Secure-1PSID` but no `__Secure-1PSIDTS`, a preflight POST to `accounts.google.com/RotateCookies` mints a fresh token before any RPC traffic, so cold-start workers no longer fail on the first call. Cross-process flock serializes concurrent cold starts; respects `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1` ([#865](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/865), [#872](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/872)).
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL` env var for enterprise NotebookLM deployments** (#402). Routes RPC + auth traffic through a non-`google.com` base URL; cookie-domain allowlist auto-extends to the enterprise host. Previously enterprise users had to monkey-patch internals.
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_RPC_OVERRIDES` env-var escape hatch.** When Google rotates a `batchexecute` method ID, set e.g. `NOTEBOOKLM_RPC_OVERRIDES='{"LIST_NOTEBOOKS": "newId123"}'` to keep working until a patch ships. Overrides are gated to `notebooklm.google.com` / `accounts.google.com` base hosts so a redirected base can't pivot them (#486).
- **`ConnectionLimits` dataclass for httpx pool tuning.** Pass `ConnectionLimits(max_connections=200, ...)` to `NotebookLMClient(...)` for long-running agents and high-fan-out workers — no more monkey-patching internals (#527).
- **`max_concurrent_rpcs` constructor arg** (default `16`, #630). Bounds simultaneous in-flight RPCs to protect the connection pool under fan-out. `None` opts out — see **Breaking changes** for the default-shift note.
- **`--include-domains` flag on `login` / `auth refresh --browser-cookies <browser>` / `auth inspect`.** Backs the REQUIRED/OPTIONAL cookie-domain split described in **Breaking changes** — passing `=youtube`/`=docs`/`=mail`/`=myaccount` (or `=all`) opts those OPTIONAL domains back in. Accepts repeated-flag or comma-separated syntax (#483).
- **In-memory `__Secure-1PSIDTS` recovery during `--browser-cookies` extraction** ([#990](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/990), [#991](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/991)). When `rookiepy` returns a partial cookie set (most often when the browser hasn't rotated `__Secure-1PSIDTS` yet), a single `RotateCookies` POST against the live browser cookies mints the missing token before persistence. Recovery declines surface scenario-specific hints (`No SID → "You are not signed in to Google in <browser>"`, `PSIDTS missing + secondary binding intact → "RotateCookies recovery did not succeed. Open https://notebooklm.google.com in <browser>"`) instead of the previous generic "No valid Google authentication cookies found".

#### Chat
- **`client.chat.delete_conversation(notebook_id, conversation_id)` + `notebooklm ask --new` is now genuinely destructive** (#824). Captures the web UI's "Delete history" action (`J7Gthc` RPC) so callers can force-end a server-side conversation; the next `ask()` with no `conversation_id` starts a brand-new thread. **⚠ Deleted turns are not recoverable.** CLI prompts for confirmation; `--json` implies `--yes`.
- **`notebooklm ask --new` flag** (previously promised in the docstring but undeclared) — starts a fresh conversation, mutually exclusive with `--conversation-id`.
- **`notebooklm ask --timeout`** per-invocation HTTP timeout, mirroring `source add --timeout`.
- **`ChatReference.answer_range` + `.score`** (#686). Every reference now exposes the answer-text span it grounds (start/end char positions) and the model's relevance score — useful for highlighting cited passages and ranking sources.
- **`chat save` preserves inline citation hover anchors** (closes #660, [#675](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/675)). Saved notes retain `[citation]`-style anchors so users can hover-preview the source passage that grounded each claim in the NotebookLM web UI.

#### CLI ergonomics
- **Uniform `--json` envelopes** on every detail and mutating command: `artifact get/rename/delete/poll/export`, eight `source` subcommands (`delete/rename/refresh/clean/get/delete-by-title/add-drive/stale`), `note get/save/create/delete/rename`, `notebooklm configure`, and `notebook use`. Detail commands mirror the underlying dataclasses; mutating commands emit `{"id": ..., "renamed|deleted|exported": true, ...}`.
- **Standard download flag set on `download quiz` / `download flashcards`** — `--all`, `--latest`, `--earliest`, `--name`, `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--no-clobber`, `--json` — so one wrapper script works across every artifact type.
- **Uniform `--timeout` / `--interval`** on `generate <kind> --wait`, `artifact wait`, and `source wait`.
- **`--limit=N` and `--no-truncate` on every `list` command, plus `--no-truncate` on `chat history`.** `chat history --no-truncate` lifts the hardcoded 50-char preview on Question/Answer columns.
- **Shell completion + ID-aware completers.** `notebooklm completion <bash|zsh|fish>` prints a completion script; once sourced, `-n/--notebook`, `-s/--source`, and `-a/--artifact` TAB-complete live IDs from the active profile.
- **SIGINT resume hint on long-running `--wait` ops.** Ctrl-C exits 130 with `Cancelled. Resume with: notebooklm artifact poll <task_id>` (or the parallel `source wait <source_id>`) instead of dumping a `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback. Under `--json`: `{"error": true, "code": "CANCELLED", "resume_hint": "..."}`.
- **Unix `-` stdin convention on `ask`, `note create`, `source add`, and `--prompt-file`.** `echo "what is X?" | notebooklm ask -` and similar pipelines now compose without temp files.
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_NOTEBOOK` env var + global `--quiet` flag.** `NOTEBOOKLM_NOTEBOOK=<id> notebooklm ask "..."` works without `-n/--notebook` or a prior `notebooklm use`. `--quiet` suppresses status output, raises the package logger floor to ERROR, and remains mutually exclusive with `-v/-vv`.
- **`source add` warns when a path-shaped argument doesn't exist.** A typo like `./missin.md` previously fell through to inline-text ingestion silently; an advisory stderr warning now fires before the source is added.
- **`--follow-symlinks` opt-in on `source add`.** See **Breaking changes** above; scripts that point at symlink-resolved paths must add the flag to keep working (#476).
- **`source clean` command** (#261). Bulk-delete failed/stale sources in a notebook; pairs with `source stale` for inspection. Supports `--all`, `--latest`, `--earliest`, `--dry-run`, and `--json`.
- **`notebooklm create --use` flag** (#220, #413). `create --use "title"` makes the new notebook the active context in one step. (Plain `create` no longer auto-switches the context — `--use` is the explicit opt-in.)
- **Chromium-profile selectors on `login --browser-cookies chromium:<profile>`** (#648). Pick a specific Chrome user profile (e.g. `chromium:Profile_1`) instead of always defaulting to the first profile. Useful for users with multiple Google accounts in one browser install.
- **`auth login --update` on `--all-accounts`** (#594). Replaces the stored state for an already-logged-in account instead of refusing on conflict.

#### Python API
- **Source fulltext markdown format.** `client.sources.get_fulltext(..., output_format="markdown")` and `source fulltext -f markdown` (closes #222). Requires the optional `markdownify` extra (`pip install "notebooklm-py[markdown]"`).
- **Public `client.rpc_call(method_id, params)`** (#646). A documented escape hatch for invoking any `batchexecute` RPC method directly when no high-level API wraps it yet. Pairs with `NOTEBOOKLM_RPC_OVERRIDES` for community self-patching while waiting on a fix.
- **Observability hooks + drain API on `NotebookLMClient`** (#643). New `on_rpc_event` callback (per-call timing + status), `client.metrics` snapshot, and `await client.drain()` for graceful shutdown. Designed for long-running agents needing visibility without monkey-patching.
- **Correlation IDs + categorized logging** (#430, #431). Every RPC carries an `X-Correlation-ID` (also surfaced on log records); log records are categorized (`rpc.call`, `rpc.retry`, `auth.refresh`, `upload.chunk`, …) for filtering. Credential redaction now covers every log surface by default.
- **Per-call upload timeouts on `sources.add_file` / `add_drive`** (#618). New `upload_timeout` / `chunk_timeout` keyword args for tuning large-file uploads against slow networks.
- **`ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion(notebook_id, task_id=None, *, timeout=1800, interval=5)`** ([#970](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/970)). Polls until research reaches a terminal state (`completed` / `failed`) or the timeout fires; passes through `task_id` on subsequent polls once the backend assigns one to prevent a later concurrent task from substituting its sources/report. Surfaces a new terminal `failed` status so wait loops no longer spin until timeout after the backend rejects a task.
- **`notebooklm.artifacts.with_rate_limit_retry(callable, *, max_retries=3, ...)`** ([#969](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/969)). Shared retry helper for the `client.artifacts.generate_*` family — catches generation-time `RateLimitError`, honors `retry_after`, and falls back to exponential backoff. Replaces the per-caller try/except/sleep boilerplate previously suggested in `docs/python-api.md`.
- **`__all__` declared on `notebooklm.paths`, `notebooklm.migration`, and `notebooklm.notebooklm_cli`** ([#958](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/958)). ADR-0012 marks all three as public modules; `__all__` now pins the exported surface (12 names on `paths`, 3 on `migration`, `cli` + `main` on the CLI entry point) so `from notebooklm.paths import *` is well-defined and the public API compatibility audit can lock it.

### Changed
- **Custom `--storage` downloads now use the selected auth file** ([#838](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/838), [#888](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/888)). `ArtifactDownloadService` previously snapshotted the session's storage path at construction time, so `--storage` overrides applied after construction were silently ignored on download. CLI `--storage` flag and mid-process profile switches are now inherited reliably.
- **`--storage <path>` derives a sibling `<path>.context.json` per file** (#467). Two `--storage` invocations against different files no longer leak notebook state through the default profile. Precedence: explicit `--storage` > profile > legacy home-root. (See **Breaking changes** for the script-impact note.)
- **Conversation IDs are now server-assigned** (#659, #667). `ChatAPI.ask()` returns whatever the server creates instead of minting a local UUID. Previously-saved conversation IDs from a v0.4.x session remain valid against the server.
- **Cross-event-loop reuse fails fast with `RuntimeError`** (#633). One `NotebookLMClient` instance is bound to its `open()`-time event loop; reusing it from a different loop (common in hot-reload servers, worker pools) now raises on the first authed POST instead of failing with cryptic httpx errors.
- **`notebook use` surfaces the typed auth-aware error on expired credentials.** Text mode shows the canonical "Not logged in" walkthrough with the `notebooklm login` remediation; `--json` emits the standard `AUTH_REQUIRED` envelope.
- **`download <type>` exception paths route through the typed error handler.** `--json` is honored on the exception path; `RateLimitError.retry_after` surfaces as both a JSON field and a "Retry after Ns" text line; `AuthError` shows the canonical re-auth hint.
- **`notebooklm login` and `notebooklm auth refresh` no longer leak Python tracebacks on unexpected failures.** Unexpected exceptions become a single friendly line + bug-report URL with exit code `2`; original traceback remains available at `-vv`.
- **`--wait` paths show a transient spinner with elapsed timer** and an empirical typical-duration hint where known (e.g. `typically 30-40 min` for cinematic-video). No-op under `--json`.
- **CLI group docstrings synced with the live registered subcommand set.** `source`, `download`, `artifact`, and `note` group `--help` blocks now enumerate every registered subcommand (previously missed `add-drive`, `add-research`, `clean`, `wait`, `cinematic-video`, `quiz`, `flashcards`, `suggestions`, `rename`).
- **`notebooklm --help` bins five previously-orphaned top-level commands** into primary sections: `auth` → **Session**; `metadata` → **Notebooks**; `agent` / `skill` / `language` → **Command Groups**.
- **`artifact poll` vs `artifact wait` `--help` clarified on ID kind.** `poll <task_id>` straight from `generate`; `wait <artifact_id>` resolved against `artifact list`.
- **First-run profile migration no longer races concurrent invocations** (#478). Previously two `notebooklm` invocations starting under a fresh home (container start-up races, parallel test runs, MCP worker pools) could both run the copy-and-delete migration. Lock waits past 30 s raise a domain-specific `MigrationLockTimeoutError(RuntimeError)`.
- **`RPCError.raw_response` previews capped at 80 chars; `NOTEBOOKLM_DEBUG=1` opts into full body.** Previously embedded a 500-char preview of the upstream response — noisy in CI and capable of leaking large server payloads (#479).
- **`RPCError.rpc_id` and `RPCError.code` deprecations revoked.** Both are now permanent aliases for `method_id` / `rpc_code` — removing exception diagnostic aliases can mask the original exception inside `except` handlers.
- **BREAKING: `note delete --json` without `--yes` and `note rename` lose-the-race now exit `1` (was `0`).** Two parallel surgical fixes to `cli/note.py` matching the broader `--json` exit-code convention (audit P1.T5). `notebooklm note delete <id> --json` without `--yes` now emits `{"error": true, "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "Pass --yes to confirm deletion in --json mode", "id": ..., "notebook_id": ...}` + exit `1` (was the same payload as `{deleted: false, error: ...}` + exit `0`). `notebooklm note rename <id> "new"` when the note vanishes between the partial-ID resolve and the underlying `get` (e.g. a concurrent `note delete`) now emits the standard `{"error": true, "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "Note not found", "id": ..., "notebook_id": ...}` envelope + exit `1` (was `{renamed: false, error: ...}` + exit `0`). **Migration:** scripts branching on the exit code now correctly catch both misconfigurations; scripts parsing the JSON body must switch from `data["deleted"] == false` / `data["renamed"] == false` checks to `data["error"] == true` (or branch on `data["code"]`).

### Deprecated
- **`await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` form.** `from_storage` now returns an awaitable async-context-manager wrapper that supports both the legacy `async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:` pattern (and bare `await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)`) and the new canonical `async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:` pattern. Awaiting the call emits `DeprecationWarning`; the await form will be removed in v1.0. Migration: drop the `await` keyword from `async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:` call sites.
- **`NotebookLMClient.rpc_call` kwargs `_is_retry`, `source_path`, `operation_variant`.** Emit `DeprecationWarning`; removal targets v0.6.0.
- **`NotesAPI.create_from_chat`.** Use `ChatAPI.save_answer_as_note`; removal targets v0.6.0.
- **Positional `wait` / `wait_timeout` on `SourcesAPI.add_url` / `add_text` / `add_file` / `add_drive`.** Calls like `client.sources.add_url(nb_id, url, True)` still work in v0.5.0 but emit `DeprecationWarning`; pass `wait=True` / `wait_timeout=...` as keywords. Removal targets v0.6.0. CLI is unaffected.
- **`SourcesAPI.add_file` `mime_type` parameter.** Never wired into the resumable-upload RPC — the server derives MIME from the filename extension. Passing a non-`None` value now emits `DeprecationWarning`; removal targets v0.6.0. The separate `add_drive(..., mime_type=...)` parameter is unaffected.
- **`notebooklm source add --mime-type` on the file-source path.** A no-op when the resolved source type is `file`; using it now emits a stderr deprecation note (suppress via `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`). Removal targets v0.6.0. The same flag on `source add-drive` is unaffected.
- **`ArtifactsAPI.wait_for_completion(poll_interval=...)`.** Use `initial_interval=...`; `poll_interval` remains accepted until v0.6.0.
- **`NotebooksAPI.share()`.** Use `client.sharing.set_public()`. Scheduled for removal in a future major release.
- **`NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0` soft-mode fallback.** Each use emits `DeprecationWarning` naming the decoder source; the soft-mode path is scheduled for removal in v0.6.0.
- **`ResearchAPI.poll(task_id=None)` default on multi-task notebooks.** When multiple research tasks are in flight, `poll()` with no `task_id` now emits `DeprecationWarning` (single-task notebooks: no warning, current behavior preserved). Scheduled for removal in a future major release.

### Removed
- **v0.3-era deprecation cycle complete.** Removed `Source.source_type`, `SourceFulltext.source_type`, `Artifact.artifact_type` (use `.kind`); `Artifact.variant` (use `.kind`, `.is_quiz`, `.is_flashcards`); `notebooklm.StudioContentType` (use `ArtifactType`); `notebooklm.DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` (use `notebooklm.paths.get_storage_path()`); `notebooklm.cli.language.save_config` (now private).
- **RPC raw-code `StudioContentType` aliases.** `notebooklm.rpc.types.StudioContentType` and `notebooklm.rpc.StudioContentType` removed; use `ArtifactType` for public code and `ArtifactTypeCode` only for low-level RPC internals.
- **`RPCMethod.DISCOVER_SOURCES` and `RPCMethod.QUERY_ENDPOINT`.** `DISCOVER_SOURCES` was an unused enum entry never exercised by any `client.*` API. `QUERY_ENDPOINT` was an endpoint URL path, not a batchexecute RPC method; use `notebooklm.rpc.get_query_url()` for the configured streamed-chat endpoint.

### Fixed
- **Artifact generation language compatibility restored.** Omitting `language` on public `client.artifacts.generate_*` calls again defaults artifact output to `"en"`; pass `language=None` to opt in to `NOTEBOOKLM_HL` default-language resolution.
- **Source upload auth/MIME routing** ([#984](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/984)). The resumable-upload path skipped a redundant env-auth lookup and now classifies media MIME types case-insensitively; `application/mp4` is included in the media-MIME set so `.mp4` uploads route through the media upload path instead of the generic file path.
- **Source upload rejection with status `3` now hints at the per-notebook source cap** ([#977](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/977)). Previously surfaced as a bare `RPCError`; the error message now suggests checking the notebook source count when the server returns the cap-rejection code.
- **Windows atomic-replace races on cookie/profile writes** ([#983](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/983)). `os.replace` on Windows can transiently fail with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` (5) or `ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION` (32) when the destination is briefly held open by AV scanners or backup software. Bounded retry with backoff handles the transient cases; persistent failures still surface.
- **IO event-loop blocking and chunked-download throughput** ([#981](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/981)). Sync `Path.resolve()` / `open()` / `os.fstat()` on the upload path are now wrapped in `asyncio.to_thread`, keeping the loop responsive under the upload semaphore on slow filesystems. Chunked downloads use a single dedicated writer thread fed by a bounded `queue.Queue` (≈512 KiB buffered) instead of spawning one `to_thread` call per 64 KiB chunk. A bug where `ArtifactDownloadError` (raised by `download_urls_batch()` for invalid scheme / untrusted host / auth failure / HTML payload) aborted the entire batch instead of landing in `DownloadResult.failed` is also fixed.
- **`notebooklm login --browser-cookies` hardening** ([#974](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/974)). Tightened Chromium account enumeration, cookie-jar normalization, and refresh writes so partial extractions surface a clear error instead of silently writing an incomplete `storage_state.json`. Pairs with the in-memory `__Secure-1PSIDTS` recovery shipped in [#990](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/990) / [#991](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/991).
- **`notebooklm login --browser-cookies` Playwright account metadata** ([#989](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/989)). The Playwright login path now writes account metadata to the profile and validates it on subsequent refresh (rejecting bool-shaped corruption from earlier buggy writes), so `notebooklm auth refresh --all-accounts` and `--account EMAIL` can target the right profile without manual cleanup.
- **Playwright account metadata repair runs after the sync context exits** ([#1000](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1000), [#1002](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/1002)). `notebooklm login` previously invoked `repair_playwright_account_metadata()` while `sync_playwright()`'s event loop was still active, which raised on `run_async()`. The repair is now deferred until after the Playwright context closes, using the captured page HTML and saved storage path.
- **`source add-research --wait` timeout path** ([#971](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/971)). The CLI service now wraps the research wait in a typed timeout error and surfaces a resumable hint (`notebooklm research poll <task_id>`) instead of hanging until the global request timeout.
- **`notebooklm auth refresh --all-accounts` language sync runs once** ([#976](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/976)). Previously re-issued the `notebooklm.SetLanguage` RPC once per account; now coalesces to a single sync at the end of the multi-account loop.
- **Loop-affinity guard on `sources.add_file` and `client.drain()` admission** ([#952](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/952)). Cross-event-loop reuse already failed fast on authed RPC POSTs (#633); upload admission and drain admission now also raise `RuntimeError` instead of silently mis-binding to the wrong loop.
- **`NotebookLMClient.close()` no longer leaks the httpx pool if cancelled mid-drain** ([#950](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/950)). A `CancelledError` raised during drain previously skipped `httpx.AsyncClient.aclose()`; close now shields the transport cleanup so the connection pool is released on every cancellation path.
- **Deep-research source import no longer requires leaving the "Add sources?" modal** ([#315](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/315), [#882](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/882)). The deep-research flow used to discover sources but skip the modal-confirm step, leaving sources pending until a separate UI action committed them. The CLI / `ResearchAPI.import_sources` now commits directly.
- **`DELETE_NOTE` no longer races shielded `UPDATE_NOTE` at cancel time** ([#876](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/876)). Cancellation during an in-flight `NotesAPI.update(...)` could land a delete before the shielded write completed, then have the update resurrect the note. Cancel-time cleanup is now ordered so `DELETE_NOTE` waits for any shielded `UPDATE_NOTE` to settle.
- **Client close preserves the original exception** (#526). `NotebookLMClient.__aexit__` previously masked the original body exception when `aclose()` itself raised. Body exceptions are now preserved (chained via `__cause__`) while close-time failures still propagate; an inner shield guarantees the underlying httpx client is closed on every path.
- **Unique temp file per concurrent artifact download** (#523). Two parallel `download_*` calls against the same artifact used to share `<dest>.tmp` and clobber each other's bytes. Each invocation now allocates a unique temp file (PID + uuid suffix) and atomically renames into place.
- **`add_file` TOCTOU fix + `max_concurrent_uploads` knob** (#595). `SourcesAPI.add_file` used to open the source file twice — a path swap between the two opens could substitute a different file into a successful upload. The file is now opened once; the FD is held across size check + registration + upload. New `max_concurrent_uploads: int | None = 4` on `NotebookLMClient` caps simultaneous in-flight uploads (doubles as an FD-exhaustion guard for `asyncio.gather` fan-outs).
- **Research `task_id` cross-wire on concurrent in-flight tasks** (#619). Two research sessions in flight on the same notebook could let `ResearchAPI.poll(notebook_id)` silently return the latest task, mis-attributing source provenance to the caller's task. `poll()` gains an optional `task_id` discriminator; `import_sources()` raises the new `ResearchTaskMismatchError` (subclass of `ValidationError`) when a `research_task_id` on any source disagrees with the caller's `task_id`.
- **`RPCHealth` surfaces `httpx` exception class name on empty error messages** ([#874](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/874)). Some `httpx` exception classes raise with empty `str(exc)`, which previously surfaced as a blank line. Health output now prefixes the class name (e.g. `ConnectTimeout:`).
- **`notebooklm login` install hint stripped the `[browser]` extra** (#416). Rich interpreted `[browser]` as a style tag, so the "Playwright not installed" message rendered as `pip install "notebooklm-py"` with no extras. Fixed by `markup=False`; also corrected the package name from `notebooklm` to `notebooklm-py`.
- **Per-create-RPC idempotency hardening** ([#801](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/801), [#806](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/806), [#808](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/808), [#809](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/809), [#813](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/813)). Six-policy idempotency registry with probe-then-retry semantics for `ADD_SOURCE`, `ADD_SOURCE_FILE`, `CREATE_NOTE`, `CREATE_ARTIFACT`, `GENERATE_MIND_MAP`, and `START_RESEARCH` / `IMPORT_SOURCES`. Resolves duplicate-create on transient retries while still raising clear errors for genuine probe failures.

### Security
- **Comprehensive secret-leak audit closed across logging, auth, and URL handling** ([#746](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/746), [#803](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/803), [#903](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/903)). A multi-iteration sweep tightening every surface that could leak credentials or grant codes:
  - `payload_preview`, `final_url`, and share-URL IDs scrubbed in error paths (#746).
  - `repr()` redaction on auth objects, `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` stdout/stderr redaction, Playwright cookie-jar domain filter, atomic profile-state writes (#803).
  - Standalone `__Secure-1PSIDTS` / `__Secure-3PSIDTS` / `__Secure-1PAPISID` / `__Secure-3PAPISID` cookie redaction in `_logging.py` (previously only caught inside `Cookie:` / `Set-Cookie:` header values); `_safe_url` redacts the URL **path** with `/<redacted>` on Google OAuth hosts (`accounts.google.com`, `oauth2.googleapis.com`, `oauth2.googleusercontent.com`) and subdomains, so opaque grant codes in paths like `/o/oauth2/auth/<token>` no longer leak through `ValueError` interpolations or CSRF / session-id drift surfaces (#903).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-11

> **Compatibility note.** Despite a few additive items (`notebooklm auth refresh` CLI, `keepalive=` constructor argument on `NotebookLMClient`, `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` env var, two new dataclass fields), 0.4.1 is shipped as a patch release because the dominant work — and the reason to ship now — is auth/cookie stability remediation. Bumping to v0.5.0 would force the long-deferred removal of v0.3-era deprecated APIs (see [Stability](docs/stability.md)) earlier than scheduled; we'd rather keep that change isolated from the auth cookie lifecycle work. All additive items are backward compatible — existing code keeps working without changes.

### Added
- **`notebooklm auth refresh` CLI command** - One-shot keepalive that opens a session, triggers the layer-1 SIDTS rotation poke against `accounts.google.com`, persists the rotated cookies to `storage_state.json`, and exits. Designed to be scheduled by the OS (launchd / systemd / cron / Task Scheduler / k8s CronJob) to keep an idle profile from staling out between user-driven calls. Pairs naturally with `--quiet` for log-only-on-error cron output. Requires file/profile-backed authentication — explicitly refuses to run when `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` is set (no writable backing store). See `docs/troubleshooting.md` for per-OS scheduler recipes (#336).
- **Periodic keepalive task on `NotebookLMClient`** - Long-lived clients (agents, workers, multi-hour `async with` blocks) can opt into a background task that periodically POSTs `RotateCookies` to drive `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation, then persists rotated cookies to `storage_state.json` immediately so a crash doesn't lose the freshness. Disabled by default — pass `keepalive=<seconds>` to `NotebookLMClient(...)` or `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` to enable. Values below `keepalive_min_interval` (default 60 s) are clamped up to that floor. The loop swallows transient errors at DEBUG and continues; cancellation on `__aexit__` is clean. Persistence runs off-loop via `asyncio.to_thread` so the loop never blocks on disk I/O. Closes the gap left by the per-call layer-1 poke for clients that never re-call `fetch_tokens` (#297, #312, #341).
- **Auto-refresh on auth expiry** - `fetch_tokens` now optionally runs a user-provided shell command when a Google session cookie has expired, reloads cookies from the same storage path, and retries once. Opt in by setting the `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` environment variable to a command that rewrites `storage_state.json` (e.g. a sync script reading from a cookie vault). Refresh commands receive `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH` and `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_PROFILE` so profile-aware scripts can target the active auth file. Covers every CLI entry point without changing the public API. Retry guards prevent refresh loops (#336).
- **`examples/refresh_browser_cookies.py`** - Sample `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` script that re-extracts cookies from a live local browser via `notebooklm login --browser-cookies`. Provides a recovery path for unattended automation when the in-process keepalive isn't enough (idle gaps, force-logout, password change).
- **`Source.created_at` and `GenerationStatus.url` public dataclass fields** - `Source.created_at` is now populated for both nested and deeply-nested response paths. `GenerationStatus.url` is now populated by `poll_status` for media artifact types (audio, video, infographic, slide-deck PDF) so callers can stream the asset as soon as the status flips to ready (#349, #356).
- **`ALLOWED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` extended for sibling Google products** - The browser-cookie import path now accepts cookies from Google's sibling product domains, restoring `--browser-cookies` flows for users whose active Google session lives on a sibling surface rather than `notebooklm.google.com` directly (#362).

### Fixed
- **Cookies could silently stale out under sustained use** - `fetch_tokens` now POSTs to `https://accounts.google.com/RotateCookies` (Chrome's dedicated unsigned rotation endpoint) before hitting `notebooklm.google.com` to drive `__Secure-1PSIDTS` / `__Secure-3PSIDTS` rotation. Empirically validated against both DBSC-bound (Playwright-minted) and unbound (Firefox-imported) profiles. RPC traffic against `notebooklm.google.com` alone does not appear to trigger rotation, so a keepalive that hit NotebookLM alone could silently stale out. The rotated `Set-Cookie` lands in the live `httpx` jar and is persisted via `save_cookies_to_storage()` along the `fetch_tokens_with_domains` / `AuthTokens.from_storage` paths. A 60 s mtime guard rate-limits the layer-1 poke — the POST is skipped when storage was recently rotated. Failures log at DEBUG and never abort token fetch. Disable with `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1` (e.g. networks that block `accounts.google.com`). Closes #312 (#345, #346).
- **Concurrent `RotateCookies` poke stampede** - The 60 s mtime guard only debounces *sequential* invocations; under `asyncio.gather` fan-out, parallel CLI loops, or MCP worker pools, all callers see the same stale `storage_state.json` mtime and stampede the POST. Three layered protections inside `_poke_session`: a per-event-loop, per-storage-path async lock registry plus a sync state lock for in-process dedup (an `asyncio.gather` of 10 fires exactly one POST), a non-blocking `LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB` flock on the new `.storage_state.json.rotate.lock` sentinel for cross-process dedup (parallel CLI loops / MCP workers skip silently when another process is rotating), and a failure-stampede protection where the timestamp updates regardless of POST outcome — so a 15 s timeout against a hung `accounts.google.com` doesn't let 10 fanned-out callers each wait the full timeout. The layer-2 keepalive loop now calls the bare `_rotate_cookies` directly (it's already self-paced via `keepalive_min_interval`) and `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE` continues to disable both layers (#347, #348).
- **`Notebook.sources_count` parsed but never surfaced** - The `sources_count` field on the public `Notebook` dataclass is now populated from `data[1]` on both LIST and GET notebook shapes; previously it always read as `0` regardless of actual source count (#350).
- **`Artifact.url` unpopulated for media artifacts** - The `url` field on the public `Artifact` dataclass is now populated for media types (audio, video, infographic; slide-deck exposes the PDF URL — use `download_slide_deck(output_format="pptx")` for PPTX) so callers no longer need to drop down to `download_*` to obtain the asset URL (#349, #356).
- **Cross-process and refresh-path save races** - Close lifecycle and refresh-path saves now serialize correctly with the keepalive writer; concurrent writers no longer overwrite each other's rotated cookies (#344).
- **Keepalive ↔ close serialization; stop mutating caller `Auth`** - The keepalive task no longer races with `__aexit__`, and no longer mutates the `Auth` instance the caller passed in. Callers that share an `Auth` across multiple clients now get the isolation the API documented (#343).
- **Snapshot keepalive cookie jar; normalize explicit `storage_path`** - The keepalive task now snapshots the live `httpx` jar before writing (avoiding torn writes when an RPC is mid-flight); an explicit `storage_path=` argument to `NotebookLMClient` is normalized onto the `Auth` instance so the keepalive task writes to the file the caller actually pointed at (#342).
- **Per-domain cookie scoping on file upload** - File-upload requests now send only cookies whose `Domain` attribute applies to the upload host, instead of the full jar. Prevents upload rejection when the jar mixes cookies for `google.com`, `notebooklm.google.com`, and `googleusercontent.com` (#373, #374).
- **Two-tier cookie validation pre-flight** - Auth loaders now distinguish "missing-but-recoverable" from "fatal" cookie states before attempting an RPC, surfacing clearer errors and avoiding doomed requests against Google's identity surface (#372).
- **Preserve cookie attributes on load** - `Domain`, `Path`, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes round-trip through storage load, restoring behaviors that depended on cross-host scoping (#365, #368).
- **Unify flat-cookie selection across loaders** - Legacy flat-cookie and modern Playwright storage shapes now share a single selection contract; subtle mismatches between the two paths are eliminated (#375, #376).
- **Tolerate non-numeric / out-of-range timestamp values on dataclasses** - `Notebook.created_at`, `Source.created_at`, and `Artifact.created_at` now catch `TypeError`, `ValueError`, `OSError`, and `OverflowError` from `datetime.fromtimestamp` and resolve to `None` instead of raising on edge-case server responses (#357).
- **`examples/refresh_browser_cookies.py` `--profile` placement** - The example invoked `... login --browser-cookies <b> --profile <p>` but `--profile` is a top-level Click option and was rejected after `login` (`Error: No such option: --profile`). Now invokes `... --profile <p> login --browser-cookies <b>` and works end-to-end against profile-backed storage.

### Infrastructure
- **Consolidated URL extraction** - `_extract_artifact_url`, per-type extractors (audio/video/infographic/slide-deck), and `_is_valid_artifact_url` moved to `types.py`. Readiness checks, `Artifact.url`, `GenerationStatus.url`, and the download paths now share one URL-selection contract: `mp4` quality-4 > any `mp4` > first valid URL for video. `SourcesAPI.get_fulltext` fixed for YouTube fulltext URLs at `metadata[5][0]` along the way (#349, #356).
- **Removed redundant `ArtifactsAPI` URL helpers** - Private `_is_valid_media_url` and `_find_infographic_url` shim methods removed; tests now exercise the canonical `types.py` helpers (#358).
- **E2E `--profile` pytest flag** - `pytest --profile <name>` scopes the E2E notebook ID cache to a named profile, so parallel multi-profile test runs don't collide on the cached notebook fixture (#340).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Multi-account profiles** - Switch between Google accounts without re-authenticating (#227)
  - `notebooklm profile create/list/switch/rename/delete` commands
  - Global `--profile` / `-p` flag and `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` environment variable to scope any command to a profile
  - Per-profile storage paths under `~/.notebooklm/profiles/<name>/`
  - Implicit default profile preserved for backward compatibility; existing `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json` is auto-detected as the default profile (no manual migration needed)
- **`notebooklm doctor` diagnostic command** - `notebooklm doctor [--fix] [--json]` checks profile setup, auth, and migration status; reports actionable issues
- **Microsoft Edge SSO login** - `notebooklm login --browser msedge` for organizations that require Edge for SSO (#204)
- **Browser cookie import** - Reuse cookies from your existing browser session without driving Playwright
  - `notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser>` (chrome, edge, firefox, safari, etc.)
  - New `convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state()` Python helper
  - Optional `[cookies]` extra installs `rookiepy` (`pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"`)
  - Honors the active profile: `notebooklm --profile <name> login --browser-cookies <browser>` writes to that profile's `storage_state.json`. Note that cookie extraction always pulls the source browser's currently-active Google account for `google.com` / `notebooklm.google.com` — to populate multiple profiles from the same browser, switch the active Google account in the browser between runs (or use a separate browser per profile).
- **EPUB source type** - Upload `.epub` files as notebook sources (#231)
- **Agent skill installation** - Install the bundled NotebookLM skill into local AI agents (#206, #207)
  - `notebooklm skill install` - Install into `~/.claude/skills/notebooklm` and `~/.agents/skills/notebooklm`
  - `notebooklm skill status` - Check installation state
  - `notebooklm agent show codex` / `notebooklm agent show claude` - Print bundled agent templates

- **`note list --json`** - Machine-readable note listings (#259)
- **Bare status codes in decoder errors** - Decoder surfaces server status codes on null RPC results for clearer diagnostics (#114, #294)

### Fixed

- **NotebookLM subdomain cookies** - Subdomain cookies are no longer dropped during login (#334)
- **Video artifact detection** - Correctly detect completed video media URLs in polling responses (#333)
- **Research import on unavailable snapshots** - CLI gracefully handles missing source snapshots during research import (#335)

- **Login subprocess on Windows** - Use `sys.executable` for Playwright subprocess calls (#279)
- **Legacy Windows Unicode output** - Sanitized output streams for legacy Windows consoles (#324)
- **Settings quota errors** - Use account limits when reporting create-quota failures (#328)
- **Chat references** - Emit references only from the winning chunk to avoid >600-element duplication (#300, #310)
- **Login retry mechanism** - Resolved race conditions and improved error handling on retry (#243)
- **Quota detection during polling** - Detect quota / daily-limit failures during artifact polling (#240)
- **Google account switching** - Fixed switching between Google accounts at login time (#246)
- **YouTube URL extraction** - Extract YouTube URLs at deeply-nested response positions (#265)
- **Bare-HTTP URL fallback** - Disabled brittle bare-HTTP fallback in `sources.list()` (#294)
- **Logout context cleanup** - Clear the active notebook context on `notebooklm logout`
- **Infographic URL extraction** - Aligned with download-path logic; added regression test (#229)
- **Custom storage path for downloads** - Artifact downloads now respect custom auth storage paths (#235)
- **Windows file permissions** - Skip Unix-only `0o600` calls on Windows and rely on Python 3.13+ ACL behavior (#225)
- **TOCTOU protection** - Hardened directory creation in `session.py` (#225)

### Changed
- **`rookiepy` is an optional `[cookies]` extra** - Excluded from `[all]` to avoid Python 3.13+ install issues; install with `pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"`
- **Login error detection** - Improved detection of missing browser binaries (e.g., `msedge` not installed)
- **Skill installation paths** - Hardened to handle alternative `~/.claude` and `~/.agents` layouts
- **Deprecation removal deferred to v0.5.0** - The deprecated APIs originally scheduled for removal in v0.4.0 — `StudioContentType`, `Source.source_type`, `SourceFulltext.source_type`, `Artifact.artifact_type`, `Artifact.variant`, and `DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` — continue to work and emit `DeprecationWarning`. Removal is now planned for v0.5.0 to give downstream users an extra release to migrate.

### ⚠️ Beta Release Notice

This is the initial public release of `notebooklm-py`. While core functionality is tested and working, please note:

- **RPC Protocol Fragility**: This library uses undocumented Google APIs. Method IDs can change without notice, potentially breaking functionality. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for debugging guidance.
- **Unofficial Status**: This is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google.
- **API Stability**: The Python API may change in future releases as we refine the interface.

### Known Issues

- **RPC method IDs may change**: Google can update their internal APIs at any time, breaking this library. Check the [RPC Development Guide](docs/rpc-development.md) for how to identify and update method IDs.
- **Rate limiting**: Heavy usage may trigger Google's rate limits. Add delays between bulk operations.
- **Authentication expiry**: CSRF tokens expire after some time. Re-run `notebooklm login` if you encounter auth errors.
- **Large file uploads**: Files over 50MB may fail or timeout. Split large documents if needed.
