# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest minor release receives security fixes. Earlier `0.x` releases predate the current API surface and are no longer maintained — please upgrade to the latest version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.8.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.8   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly (see `pyproject.toml` for contact info)
3. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Credential Security

This library stores authentication credentials locally. Please understand these security considerations:

### Storage Locations

By default, files are stored per-profile under `~/.notebooklm/profiles/<profile>/` (configurable via the `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` and `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` environment variables). Legacy layouts store files directly in the root of `~/.notebooklm/` (representing the `default` profile). Permission modes below are POSIX modes; Windows uses the inherited filesystem ACLs and intentionally skips `chmod`.

| File Path | Contents | Permissions |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `profiles/<profile>/storage_state.json` | Google session cookies | `0o600` (owner-only) |
| `profiles/<profile>/browser_profile/` | Playwright Chromium profile | `0o700` (owner-only) |
| `profiles/<profile>/context.json` | Active profile context / metadata | `0o600` (owner-only) |
| `config.json` | Global CLI config (e.g. language/active profile) | Default |
| `storage_state.json` *(legacy)* | Fallback root storage state (for `default` profile) | `0o600` (owner-only) |
| `browser_profile/` *(legacy)* | Fallback root Playwright profile | `0o700` (owner-only) |
| `context.json` *(legacy)* | Fallback root active notebook context | `0o600` (owner-only, POSIX) |

### Security Best Practices

1. **Protect your credentials**
   - The `storage_state.json` file contains your Google session cookies
   - Anyone with access to this file can impersonate your Google account to NotebookLM
   - Never share, commit, or expose this file

2. **Add to .gitignore**
   ```gitignore
   .notebooklm/
   ```

3. **Credential rotation**
   - Re-run `notebooklm login` periodically to refresh credentials
   - Sessions typically last days to weeks before expiring

4. **If credentials are compromised**
   - Immediately revoke access at [Google Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
   - Delete the `~/.notebooklm/` directory
   - Re-authenticate with `notebooklm login`

5. **CI/CD usage**
   - Do not commit credentials to repositories
   - Use `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` environment variable for secure, file-free authentication
   - Store the JSON value in GitHub Secrets or similar secure secret management
   - The env var approach keeps credentials in memory only, never written to disk

### What This Library Does NOT Do

- Does not transmit credentials to any third party
- Does not store passwords (uses browser-based OAuth)
- Does not access data outside of NotebookLM except for user-selected local files
  and opt-in browser-cookie extraction during login/refresh
- Does not modify Google account settings

## Dependency Security

This library keeps the base dependency set small and puts optional surfaces behind
extras:

| Dependency | Scope | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `httpx` | base | HTTP client |
| `click` | base | CLI framework |
| `rich` | base | Terminal output |
| `filelock` | base | Cross-process file locking for profile/context writes |
| `markdownify` | `markdown` extra | HTML-to-Markdown conversion |
| `playwright` | `browser` extra | Interactive/headless browser login |
| `rookiepy` | `cookies` extra | Opt-in browser-cookie import |
| `fastmcp` | `mcp` extra | MCP server adapter |
| `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `python-multipart` | `server` extra | Optional REST server and file uploads |

### Auditing Dependencies

```bash
# Mirror CI: audit the locked selected-extra graph
uv sync --frozen --extra browser --extra dev --extra markdown
uv run python -m pip install "pip-audit>=2.7.0,<3"
uv export --frozen --extra browser --extra dev --extra markdown --format requirements-txt --no-emit-project \
  | uv run pip-audit --strict --require-hashes --disable-pip -r /dev/stdin

# Release/security sweep: include maintained MCP + REST server extras too
uv export --frozen --extra browser --extra dev --extra markdown --extra mcp --extra server \
  --format requirements-txt --no-emit-project \
  | uv run pip-audit --strict --require-hashes --disable-pip -r /dev/stdin
```

The `cookies` extra remains an explicit opt-in because `rookiepy` has had
interpreter compatibility issues; audit that graph separately when changing the
browser-cookie import surface.

## Known Limitations

### Undocumented API

This library uses Google's internal APIs, which means:

- **No official security guarantees** from Google
- **API changes without notice** may break functionality
- **Rate limiting** may be applied by Google
- **Account restrictions** are possible for unusual usage patterns

### Session Security

- Sessions are cookie-based (standard web authentication)
- CSRF tokens are required and automatically handled
- No long-lived API keys or OAuth tokens
