# MCP server guide

> **Experimental / preview.** The MCP server ships behind the optional `mcp` extra. Its

The MCP server exposes NotebookLM to any [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, …) as a set of **33 tools** — manage
notebooks and sources, chat over a notebook's sources, generate and download studio artifacts,
and run deep research. It is a thin adapter over the same business logic the CLI uses, so it
behaves identically to `notebooklm <command>`.

## Install

The server is behind the `mcp` extra (pulls in `fastmcp`):

```bash
pip install "notebooklm-py[mcp]"
# or run with no install, straight from PyPI:
uvx --from "notebooklm-py[mcp]" notebooklm-mcp --help
```

## Authenticate (once)

The server reuses the CLI's stored credentials — it does **not** log in on its own. Authenticate
once before starting it:

```bash
notebooklm login
# or, if you didn't install the package:
uvx --from "notebooklm-py[mcp]" notebooklm login
```

Credentials are stored per profile under `~/.notebooklm/`. The server binds the **active profile**
at startup (override with `--profile`, below). See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for profiles
and multi-account setup.

## Connect a client

The fastest path is the auto-config command, which writes the server block into a client's MCP
config (idempotent, never clobbers other servers):

```bash
notebooklm mcp install claude-desktop   # or: claude-code | cursor | windsurf
```

| Client | Config written |
|--------|----------------|
| `claude-desktop` | `claude_desktop_config.json` (per-OS location) |
| `claude-code` | `~/.claude.json` (user scope) |
| `cursor` | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
| `windsurf` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` |

It writes a block that launches the server via `uvx` (so only `uv` needs to be on the host):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "notebooklm-py[mcp]", "notebooklm-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client after installing. For a one-click Claude Desktop bundle,
download `notebooklm-mcp.mcpb` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/releases/latest)
(**Assets**) and use "Install Extension"; see
[`desktop-extension/README.md`](../desktop-extension/README.md) for details.

## Run it directly

The console script is `notebooklm-mcp`:

```bash
notebooklm-mcp                         # stdio transport (default — for desktop hosts)
notebooklm-mcp --profile work          # bind a specific auth profile
notebooklm-mcp --transport http        # loopback streamable-HTTP on 127.0.0.1:9420
notebooklm-mcp --transport http --port 9000
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `--profile` | active profile | which stored auth profile the process binds |
| `--transport` | `stdio` | `stdio` (subprocess hosts) or `http` (loopback) |
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | http only; non-loopback is **refused** unless `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_BIND=1` |
| `--port` | `9420` | http only |
| `--log-level` | `INFO` | logs go to **stderr**; stdout stays pure JSON-RPC |

There is no `--token` flag — the HTTP bearer token is **env-only**
(`NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_TOKEN`) so it cannot leak via `ps aux`.

`stdio` is right for Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, and Windsurf (they launch the server as a
subprocess). Use `http` for a local web client or to share one running server across clients on
the same machine. The HTTP transport is loopback-only by default; binding to a non-loopback
address requires **both** the explicit `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_BIND=1` override **and** a
`NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_TOKEN` — the server fails closed (refuses to start) on a network bind without a
token, since it fronts a full Google account.

## Remote deployment (Docker + a tunnel)

Because master-token auth keeps the session alive unattended (no browser), the HTTP transport can
run as a **remote connector** reachable from Claude Code, Claude Desktop, claude.ai, mobile, and ChatGPT.
The [`deploy/`](../deploy/) directory ships a turn-key Docker + Compose stack with a **tunnel
sidecar** — pick one via a Compose profile — so you get HTTPS with **no public IP, no open ports,
and no TLS certificate to manage** (the tunnel terminates TLS at its edge).

**→ The full step-by-step lives in [`deploy/README.md`](../deploy/README.md)** — run it from
inside `deploy/` (`make setup` → finish the one manual tunnel step → `make up`), where the Compose
stack, `Makefile`, and `.env.example` it references sit. It walks both tunnels end to end:
**Cloudflare** (needs a domain in your Cloudflare account) and **Tailscale Funnel** (no domain — a
free, stable `*.ts.net` HTTPS hostname). The rest of this section is the two things worth knowing
before you start: the auth model and remote file transfer.

**Two auth methods coexist on one `/mcp`** (FastMCP `MultiAuth`):
- **Claude Code / Desktop** → the static `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_TOKEN` bearer (an `Authorization` header).
- **claude.ai (web/mobile) and ChatGPT** (Developer Mode) → optional **self-hosted OAuth** (one
  password, no external IdP): set `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD` (≥16 random chars) +
  `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_BASE_URL` (the **bare public origin**, no `/mcp`). Both connector UIs are
  OAuth-only (no bearer field). Unset → bearer-only (Claude Code/Desktop still work).

Use a **dedicated/throwaway Google account** — the mounted `master_token.json` is a durable
full-account credential. Multi-tenant hosting is out of scope for this single-tenant setup.

**Where OAuth state lives.** The registered clients + issued tokens persist to a
deployment-scoped file keyed on `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_BASE_URL` (the OAuth issuer), **not**
the served account profile: `<home>/oauth/<slug>.json` by default (the Docker deploy mounts
this at `/data/oauth` — the `make` targets pre-create the host dir `0700`; direct `docker
compose up` users must `mkdir -p ./oauth-state && chmod 700 ./oauth-state` first), or set
`NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_STATE_PATH` to override. Because it's keyed on the base_url, **switching the served profile/account no longer
orphans your registered clients** (ChatGPT/claude.ai stay connected), and two servers with
different origins on one host keep separate registries. On first startup after upgrading, a
legacy `oauth_state.json` in the **active profile dir** is migrated once (then renamed
`.migrated`, so it's never re-read); if you keep OAuth state elsewhere or had already switched
profiles, copy it across manually first — `cp <old-profile-dir>/oauth_state.json <new-path>`
(Docker: into your `./oauth-state` mount). Treat the file as a full-account secret. Keying
on the issuer also isolates two servers reachable via different origins (a token minted for
one base_url is never routed through another), but it requires a **stable** hostname — an
ephemeral tunnel URL that changes on restart shifts the slug and re-orphans clients.

### File upload & download (remote)

The MCP/JSON-RPC channel can't carry large binaries, so over a remote connector
`source_add type=file` and `studio_download` broker a **short-lived signed URL**
served by the same container; your browser does the byte transfer (see
[ADR-0024](adr/0024-mcp-remote-file-transfer.md)). This is the standard pattern for
remote MCP file transfer — MCP has no native file-upload primitive, and its native
download (binary Resources) is capped far below a podcast/video. (A **small** file
can skip the signed URL entirely — see `source_add(..., bytes_base64=…)` below.)

**Enable it:** set `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_PUBLIC_URL` to your bare public origin (the same
host as the tunnel, no `/mcp`). It falls back to `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_BASE_URL`, so
if you configured claude.ai OAuth above, **file transfer is already on**. Unset on a
bearer-only deploy → the two file tools return a clear "not configured" error
(everything else still works; the server does not refuse to start).

- **Upload a local file:** `source_add type=file` returns an `upload_required` link.
  Open it in your browser, pick the file, and it's added to the notebook. (Claude can
  also `PUT` a file it already holds to that link from its **code-execution sandbox** —
  but that requires Code Execution enabled **and your server domain whitelisted** in
  claude.ai Settings → Capabilities → additional allowed domains, or the `PUT` fails.)
- **Hand a small file's bytes in-channel (no signed URL):** when an agent holds the
  bytes but can complete *neither* upload path — e.g. its egress is blocked, so the
  `agent_upload` POST fails, and no human device has the file — call
  `source_add(source_type="file", bytes_base64=…, filename=…)`: it takes the file as
  base64 (≤ 10,000 chars, ≈ 7 KB) and the connector adds it server-side, returning the
  source directly. It works on any transport and needs no `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_PUBLIC_URL`; a
  larger file must use the `source_add type=file` signed-URL flow above.
- **Download an artifact:** `studio_download` returns a `download_ready` link (a
  clickable `resource_link`); open it to stream the podcast/video/PDF to your device.
  The `download_ready` payload is self-describing so a client can render a download
  affordance *before* opening the URL: alongside `url` / `expires_at` / `artifact_type`
  / `artifact_id` it carries `filename` (the artifact title — or the type name on a
  latest-by-type download — plus the format-resolved extension), `mime_type` (from a
  central per-type/format table the `/files/dl` route serves with, so the advertised
  type and the streamed `Content-Type` can't drift), and `size_bytes` (`null` — the
  size isn't known without eagerly fetching the artifact, which the broker won't do;
  the route sets the real `Content-Length` when the link is opened).
- **Confirm an upload landed:** `await_upload` (pass the `human_upload.url` or bare token)
  polls the in-process completion record and returns `{source_id, file:{name, size, mime,
  sha256}}` once the add commits — `sha256` is the digest of exactly the bytes the server
  received, so a client that hashed its local copy can confirm byte-integrity. An agent
  `PUT`ing to the upload URL may also append `?sha256=<hex>`: the route verifies the received
  stream against it and rejects a corrupted transfer with a clean 400 (retryable) *before*
  adding the source.
- Links are HMAC-signed and short-lived (upload 15 min, download 30 min) and expire on
  a server restart. Google Drive (`source_add` with a Drive id) remains a no-browser
  alternative for adding files. stdio (local) installs are unchanged — they still read
  and write real local paths directly.

## Core concepts

These conventions hold across every tool:

- **JSON by default.** Read/wait tools, including `source_read`, `source_wait`, and
  `source_add(..., wait=True)`, return a JSON text content block plus the same
  `structured_content`. A `resource_link` appears only when a tool explicitly brokers
  file transfer, such as `studio_download`.
- **Name *or* ID.** Every `notebook`/`source`/`note`/`artifact` argument accepts a human title **or**
  an ID. Both resolve by prefix: an exact title wins, otherwise a **unique title prefix** matches
  (so `"Scientific"` finds `"Scientific PDF Parsing — …"`), and likewise a full ID or a unique ID
  prefix. Use the matching `*_list` tool to discover them. An ambiguous name or prefix returns a
  `VALIDATION` error listing the candidates so you can retry with an exact title or ID. When a name
  lookup *fails* but is close to a real title — a punctuation-only slip such as a hyphen typed for an
  em-dash (`—`) or a normal space for a non-breaking one — the error's `Did you mean: …` hint names
  up to three near-miss candidates, each with its **title and id** inline, so you can retry with the
  full title or id instead of guessing (a label near-miss reached via `source_list(label=…)` gets the
  same enrichment on its `VALIDATION` error).
- **Canonical IDs come back.** Every response echoes the canonical `notebook_id` (and, where a
  tool resolves them, the `source_ids` scope / `artifact_id`) — so a call made by *name* hands you
  the id to chain the next call on.
- **Strict IDs-only mode (opt-in).** Set `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_STRICT_IDS=1` on the server to require a
  **full canonical id** for every `notebook`/`source`/`note`/`artifact` reference: names, titles, and
  short id prefixes are rejected with a `VALIDATION` error *before* any list call. This trades the
  convenience above for deterministic, fail-fast behavior in long-lived automation, where a prefix or
  title that is unique today can quietly resolve to a different (or ambiguous) entity tomorrow. Off by
  default. (Governs every notebook/source/note/artifact reference — including studio `item` and
  `studio_download`'s `artifact_id`; the `source_list(label=…)` name filter is out of scope.)
- **Destructive tools need confirmation.** `notebook_delete`, `source_delete`,
  `studio_delete`, and `share_remove_user` take `confirm` (default `false`). Called without it, they return a `needs_confirmation` preview
  (with the resolved title) and delete **nothing**; call again with `confirm=true` to execute.
- **Sharing-widening tools need confirmation too.** `share_set_user` (every grant/regrade) and
  `share_set_access` when it would widen link access (`public=true` on a currently-restricted
  notebook) take `confirm` (default `false`) and return a `needs_confirmation` preview instead of
  mutating; call again with `confirm=true` to apply. Restricting (`public=false`) and
  `view_level`-only changes are not gated. These tools are *not* flagged `destructiveHint` — the
  gate is on the widening direction only.
- **Long-running work is non-blocking.** `studio_generate` returns immediately with a `task_id`;
  poll `studio_status` until it's complete, then `studio_download`. Research is the same shape:
  `research_start` → `research_status` → `research_import`.
- **Mutation envelope.** Synchronous create/rename/update/delete tools return a top-level
  `status` string naming the outcome — one of `created`, `renamed`, `updated`, `deleted`,
  `removed`, `added`, `imported`, `already_imported`, `cancel_requested`, `configured` (plus the
  `needs_confirmation` / `upload_required` / `download_ready` flow values) — alongside the
  affected id(s). An agent can
  branch on `status` uniformly instead of learning a different success shape per tool. Two
  carve-outs: the **long-running starters** `studio_generate` / `research_start` return a
  `task_id` (the handle *is* the result — poll it) rather than a mutation status — as does the
  re-runner `studio_retry` (its `task_id` equals the artifact id); and the **read** tools
  `studio_status` / `research_status` key `status` to a lifecycle vocabulary
  (`in_progress` / `completed` / …), a *different* enum. (Batch
  `source_add` reports `added` once ≥1 succeeded, `error` if all failed — see the `added` /
  `failed` tallies + per-item `results[].status` for partial outcomes.)
- **Structured errors.** Failures arrive as `CODE: message (retriable=…)`, where `CODE` is one of
  `AUTH`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION`, `TIMEOUT`, `NETWORK`, `SERVER`, `RPC`,
  `CONFIG`, `DEPENDENCY`, `NOTEBOOK_LIMIT`, `ARTIFACT_TIMEOUT`, `SOURCE_MUTATION`, `SOURCE_ADD`,
  `ERROR`, or `UNEXPECTED`. The
  `retriable` flag tells an agent whether a retry could succeed (e.g. `RATE_LIMITED`, `TIMEOUT`,
  `NETWORK`). Many errors also carry an actionable `hint` (e.g. `AUTH → run notebooklm login`); a
  near-miss name lookup puts its `Did you mean: …` candidates (title + id) in that hint (see
  **Name *or* ID** above).

## Workflows

The examples below are MCP **tool calls** an agent makes (not shell commands).

### Add sources and ask a question

```text
nb = notebook_create(title="Quantum Computing")
source_add(notebook="Quantum Computing", source_type="url", url="https://arxiv.org/abs/...")
source_add(notebook="Quantum Computing", source_type="text", title="Notes", text="...")
source_wait(notebook="Quantum Computing")                 # block until sources finish processing
chat_ask(notebook="Quantum Computing", question="What are the open problems?")
```

`source_wait` returns a structured aggregate: the four buckets (`ready` carries
`source_view` rows; `timed_out`/`failed`/`not_found` carry `{source_id, error}`)
plus explicit `*_count` scalars and a `total_count` for at-a-glance triage — so a
client reads the counts without folding `len()` over every array. The counts are
additive; the arrays stay for backward compatibility. `ok` is `true` iff every
error bucket is empty, and `total_count` = `ready_count` + `timed_out_count` +
`failed_count` + `not_found_count`:

```text
source_wait(notebook="Quantum Computing")
# → {"notebook_id": ..., "ok": false,
#    "ready":     [{"id": ..., "title": "Notes", "kind": "pasted_text", "status_label": "ready",
#                    "drive_status_label": null, "is_drive_degraded": false}],
#    "timed_out": [{"source_id": ..., "error": "..."}],
#    "failed":    [],
#    "not_found": [],
#    "ready_count": 1, "timed_out_count": 1, "failed_count": 0,
#    "not_found_count": 0, "total_count": 2}
```

`source_type` is one of `url`, `text`, `file` (local `path`), `drive` (a
`document_id` + a **required** `mime_type`, one of
`google-doc`/`google-slides`/`google-sheets`/`pdf` — there is no default, since
defaulting a non-Doc Drive file to `google-doc` fails the import), or `youtube`.
NotebookLM's Drive import only ingests those four by reference (Google-native
Docs/Slides/Sheets + PDF); an upload-only Drive file (e.g. epub/docx/pptx/txt/md/rtf/
odt/csv) cannot be added via `drive` — use `source_add_drive_file(notebook,
document_id)` instead, which downloads it server-side and uploads it (no local
download step, and it works over the remote connector too).
URL and YouTube adds reject
internal/loopback hosts by default; pass `allow_internal=true` only for
deliberate local NotebookLM tests. `chat_ask` continues the most-recent
conversation unless you pass a `conversation_id`.

To add ONE source and block until it finishes processing in a single call, pass
`wait=true` to `source_add` — it composes single-mode `source_add` + `source_wait`, so
you skip the add→wait round-trip. It takes the same single-mode add inputs plus the
`timeout`/`interval` wait knobs, and returns the `source_wait` aggregate plus a
top-level `source_id` (always present — the source persists even if the wait times out
or the import fails, so you can retry or delete it):

```text
source_add(notebook="Quantum Computing", source_type="url",
           url="https://arxiv.org/abs/...", wait=true)
# → {"notebook_id": ..., "ok": true,
#    "ready":     [{"id": ..., "title": "...", "kind": "web_page", "status_label": "ready",
#                    "drive_status_label": null, "is_drive_degraded": false}],
#    "timed_out": [], "failed": [], "not_found": [],
#    "ready_count": 1, "timed_out_count": 0, "failed_count": 0,
#    "not_found_count": 0, "total_count": 1, "source_id": ...}
```

`wait` is single-source only (not valid with a `urls` batch) and cannot one-shot a
**remote** `file` signed-URL upload (that upload is a separate step — add it, then
`source_wait`, or pass `bytes_base64` for a tiny file).

To ingest many URLs at once, pass `urls` (batch mode) instead of `source_type`
— one call instead of one round-trip each. The response is an explicit per-item
list so a partial failure is never hidden behind a single success flag:

```text
source_add(notebook="Quantum Computing", urls=[
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00001",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...",
])
# → {"notebook_id": ..., "added": 2, "failed": 0,
#    "results": [{"input": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00001", "status": "added", "source_id": ..., "title": ...},
#                {"input": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...", "status": "added", "source_id": ..., "title": ...}]}
```

Batch mode is URL-only (a non-URL entry is reported as a per-item `VALIDATION`
error, never added as text); `source_type`/`url`/`text`/`title`/`path`/
`document_id`/`mime_type` are not valid with `urls`, but `allow_internal`
applies to every entry.

Validated URLs share one batch-capable `ADD_SOURCE` RPC rather than issuing one
write per item. NotebookLM can admit a subset and omit rejected rows from that
response, so the client reconciles omissions with one `source_list(status="error")`
read while keeping `results[i]` paired with `urls[i]`. The public single-item
`sources.add_url()` path is unchanged. A transport failure is deliberately not
replayed: an unknown subset may already have committed, so first reconcile with
`source_list` before resubmitting. Avoid exact duplicate URLs within one batch;
if the backend admits only some identical copies, it returns no request positions
with which to disambiguate them and the call fails closed with the same guidance.

### Content-sanity warnings on ready web pages

A dead link, [soft-404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404#Soft_404), or
paywalled page frequently ingests as a **READY** source with little-to-no
extractable text — a "ghost source" that add-time status can't catch because a
soft-404 serves HTTP 200. `source_wait` — and batch `source_add(urls=[...])` for
an item that is *already* READY the moment it returns (single-mode `source_add`
adds asynchronously, so it never runs this check) — attaches a non-blocking,
advisory `warning` to such a source. The check is **best-effort and never
rejects**: the source stays READY, `ok` stays `true`, and any fetch failure
(including a >5s slow `source_read`) degrades to no warning rather than breaking
the wait.

It fires on a **web-page source only** (`kind == "web_page"`) via three body-only
signals — the title is never scanned:

| Signal | Threshold | Warning contains |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **char-thin** | indexed text shorter than **100 characters** | `"little/no text extracted (N chars) …"` |
| **dead-link boilerplate** | **indexed text** shorter than **2000 characters** that (casefolded) contains any of the dead-link phrases below | `"ingested as ready (N chars) but the body matches a dead-link / error-page pattern …"` |
| **bot-challenge / WAF interstitial** | **indexed text** shorter than **5000 characters** that (casefolded) contains any of the challenge phrases below | `"ingested as ready (N chars) but the body matches a bot-challenge / WAF interstitial pattern …"` |

The full dead-link phrase set (the complete list, so you can build a fixture that
trips it): `broken link`, `page not found`, `page isn't available`, `page does
not exist`, `page no longer available`, `no longer available`, `error 404`, `404
not found`, `whoops!`.

The full bot-challenge phrase set (a Cloudflare "Just a moment…" or Akamai
"Access Denied" page that serves HTTP 200 and indexes as ready): `just a moment`,
`enable javascript and cookies`, `checking your browser`, `attention required`,
`access denied`, `security verification`, `captcha`, `cloudflare ray id`. The
dead-link scan takes precedence when a body trips both.

Each gate measures the source's **indexed text** length (`char_count` from a
`source_read` with `detail="full"`), not the raw HTTP response — a large HTML
page that indexes to little text is still caught. The length gate is what keeps
the phrases safe: a page whose indexed text is at/over its cap (2000 for
dead-link, 5000 for bot-challenge) is never phrase-scanned (so `broken link` in a
real article about broken links, or a passing mention of a WAF vendor, does not
false-positive), and the phrases are all multi-word / anchored — no bare `404` or
`not found`. Every warning ends with `verify with source_read (detail="full").`
(trailing period included).

**To exercise the warning branch** (the reason this is documented): note that a
`text` source — even an empty one — is *never* flagged; only a `web_page` under
the thresholds above is. So the reliable trigger is a URL that resolves to a
near-empty or soft-404 page. To unit-test your own handling of the branch
without a live URL, mock the source's fetched body under the threshold and assert
the warning shape — copy the pattern from
[`tests/unit/mcp/test_sources.py`](../tests/unit/mcp/test_sources.py) (see
`test_source_wait_thin_web_page_warns`, `test_source_wait_soft_404_body_phrase_warns`,
and the `_THIN_SOURCE_CHAR_THRESHOLD` boundary test).

### Generate and download a studio artifact

```text
task = studio_generate(notebook="Quantum Computing", artifact_type="audio")
studio_status(notebook="Quantum Computing", task_id="<task_id from above>")   # poll until complete
studio_download(notebook="Quantum Computing", artifact_type="audio", path="podcast.m4a")

# Target a specific/older artifact instead of the latest-by-type (full ID or unique prefix):
studio_download(notebook="Quantum Computing", artifact_type="audio", path="old_podcast.m4a", artifact_id="aaaaaaaa-aaaa")

# Per-kind styling options are agent-settable, e.g. a custom-styled video:
studio_generate(notebook="Quantum Computing", artifact_type="video",
                  style="custom", style_prompt="hand-drawn diagrams")
```

`studio_download`'s `output_format` overrides the download file format, but only
some artifact types have a format axis:

| `artifact_type` | Supported `output_format` |
| --- | --- |
| `slide-deck` | `pdf` (default), `pptx` |
| `quiz`, `flashcards` | `json` (default), `markdown`, `html` |
| `audio`, `video`, `infographic`, `report`, `mind-map`, `data-table` | none — omit `output_format` |

Passing `output_format` to a type with no format axis (e.g. `report` +
`markdown`) is a validation error that says `supported formats: default only`
rather than silently ignoring it, and the message is identical whether the
download runs over stdio (`path`) or the remote signed-URL connector.

`artifact_type` is one of `audio`, `video`, `cinematic-video`, `slide-deck`, `quiz`, `flashcards`,
`infographic`, `data-table`, `mind-map`, `report`. Each kind's styling options are agent-settable
(matching the CLI flags): `audio_format` / `audio_length` (audio); `video_format` / `style` /
`style_prompt` (video — `style` / `style_prompt` are rejected for `video_format` `cinematic` and
`short`, which use a fixed visual style); `deck_format` / `deck_length` (slide-deck); `quantity` / `difficulty`
(quiz, flashcards); `orientation` / `detail` / `style` (infographic); `map_kind` (mind-map);
and `report_format` (report). `cinematic-video` and `data-table` take no per-kind options. An
option is valid only for its own kind — passing one to a different `artifact_type` is a
validation error, not a silent no-op.

### Run deep research and import the findings

```text
task = research_start(notebook="Quantum Computing", query="post-quantum cryptography", source="web", mode="deep")
research_status(notebook="Quantum Computing", poll_task_id=task["poll_task_id"])
research_import(notebook="Quantum Computing", poll_task_id=task["poll_task_id"])
```

`source` is `web` or `drive`; `mode` is `fast` or `deep`. Pass the
`poll_task_id` returned by `research_start` — under the **same** parameter name,
`poll_task_id` — when polling, importing, or cancelling, so the value copies
verbatim from one tool's output into the next and the request is pinned to the
intended research task (for a **deep** run it is the `report_id`; the raw
`task_id` is an unpollable sessionId). Omitting the pin on `research_status` is
allowed only when the notebook has a single in-flight task. `research_status`
omits the large report by default — pass `include_report=true` to fetch it once
`completed`.

`research_import` is timeout-tolerant: a deep import that times out is reconciled
against what the server actually committed (rather than reported as if nothing
imported). It's also idempotent — unless `allow_duplicate=true`, sources already
present (matched by URL) are skipped and reported as `already_present` rather
than re-added, so re-importing the same task is normally safe to retry. That
pre-filter needs a successful pre-import source-list snapshot: if the baseline
`sources.list` call itself fails (network/RPC error), the import proceeds
without it, and a retry in that state can re-add already-present sources.
Entries with no dedupable URL (report-only / pasted-text sources) are always
imported regardless. Pass `allow_duplicate=true` to skip the pre-filter and
re-add matching sources anyway. Pass `cited_only=true` to import only the sources the report cites, or
`max_sources=N` to cap how many are imported (applied after `cited_only`) so one
call can't blow the notebook's source cap.

> **Deprecated (removed in v0.9.0):** `research_status`/`research_import` also
> accept the old `task_id` name and `research_cancel` the old `run_id` name as
> aliases for `poll_task_id`. Passing an alias still works but emits a
> `DeprecationWarning` and adds a `deprecation` note to the result — switch to
> `poll_task_id`. See [docs/deprecations.md](deprecations.md).

## Experimental: in-app upload widget

Set `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_UPLOAD_WIDGET=1` (http transport + a public URL required) to expose
`source_add_widget(notebook)` — an **MCP-App** tool that renders a file picker *inline* in
MCP-Apps hosts (e.g. claude.ai), so a mobile user can pick and upload **one or more files** (up to
10 per call) without leaving the chat. The tool returns a small pool of independent single-use
tokens (`upload_urls`, one per file); the widget uploads each file to its own token via the same
signed `/files/ul` route as the link flow — so multi-file needs no change to the route or the
single-use invariant. The pool is minted up front but uploaded sequentially, so its tokens carry a
longer **1 h** lifetime (vs the 15-min single link) so a late file in a slow batch can't outlive its
token. To confirm, call `await_upload` on the specific `upload_urls` entry for a
file (`upload_url` is the first of the pool, kept for back-compat), or use `source_list` to verify
the whole batch — for a multi-file add, don't rely on `upload_url` alone (the first file may be
skipped while later ones land).

**Opt-in and experimental** (off by default): MCP-Apps rendering is new (Jan 2026) and
host-specific; the widget resolves host render gates (`_meta.ui.domain` computed from your public
URL, the flat `ui/resourceUri` key) that a host can change. If it doesn't render, the widget
silently no-ops and the portable **signed-link flow stays the fallback** — nothing else breaks.
It stays off the default tool surface (and the ADR-0025 tool budgets) unless enabled. See
[ADR-0027](adr/0027-mcp-app-upload-widget.md).

Enabling the widget **auto-enables stateless HTTP** (`FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP`): an MCP-Apps host
fetches the `ui://` widget resource on a connection *without* the chat session id, and a stateful
server rejects that with "fail to fetch app content". Set `FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP` explicitly to
override. Stateless is harmless for ordinary tool use (each request is self-contained). Note:
ChatGPT caches the widget template per conversation, so the *first* `source_add_widget` call in a
new chat may not render — call it again and it will (a ChatGPT-side quirk, not a server issue).

## Known limitations for autonomous deep-research ingestion

Curated, interactive use of these tools is solid. **Autonomous bulk deep-research
ingestion** hits a handful of Google-NotebookLM *backend* behaviors this client cannot
change — the client surfaces them faithfully, but an agent driving unattended imports
should **audit the result after the fact** rather than assume all-or-nothing success.
Client-actionable follow-ups are tracked in
[#1919](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1919)–[#1924](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1924).

- **Research import is not truly atomic.** `research_import` can commit a *partial*
  import even when the call errors (e.g. on a timeout) — some findings land, some don't.
  There is no server-side all-or-nothing guarantee. After any errored or timed-out
  import, call `source_list` to reconcile what actually persisted before retrying.
  Client-side timeout reconciliation is tracked in
  [#1920](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1920).
- **Retrying a partial import used to fail — now it's idempotent for URL-addressed
  entries, when the baseline snapshot succeeds.** The raw `IMPORT_RESEARCH`
  RPC rejects a source it already committed with a server-side `FAILED_PRECONDITION` (gRPC 9),
  so a naive retry didn't cleanly resume. `research_import` now pre-filters requested sources
  against the notebook's current sources by URL before every attempt, so re-importing the same
  completed task skips what already landed (reported as `already_present`) instead of hitting
  that error. This needs a successful baseline `sources.list` snapshot — if that call itself
  fails, the pre-filter is skipped and a retry can re-add sources — and only applies to entries
  with a dedupable URL (report-only / pasted-text entries are always re-imported). Pass
  `allow_duplicate=true` to re-add matching sources anyway. Fixed by
  [#1961](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1961).
- **A failed source add can leave a ghost row.** A rejected add (e.g. the 51st source over
  a limit) can still persist a backend row, so the notebook's source count may read one
  higher than the sources that actually imported. Verify against `source_list` /
  `source_wait` rather than the raw count; count-inflation handling is tracked in
  [#1919](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1919).
- **Deep research does not hard-enforce a primary-source / authority preference.**
  Discovery and ranking happen server-side; a query that asks for "authoritative" or
  "primary" sources steers the model but is **advisory**, not a hard filter. There is no
  client lever over which sources research discovers.
- **Chat source-quality instructions are softly followed.** Telling `chat_ask` to "use
  only authoritative sources" is natural-language guidance, not a retrieval filter. The
  one **hard, deterministic** lever is `chat_ask`'s `source_ids` — scope the answer to the
  exact sources you trust. Domain/authority filtering is backend-gated.
- **Note-backed vs interactive mind maps differ in instruction adherence.** The
  note-backed generation path can collapse a cross-source request into a single-source
  outline; the interactive mind map follows a multi-source instruction more closely. This
  is server-side generation behavior, not a client bug.
- **AI source summaries are interpretive.** `source_read(detail=summary)` returns a
  model-generated summary — there is no extractive/verbatim mode exposed by the backend.
  Use `detail=full` when you need the indexed source text itself.
- **A custom title on a direct Drive add is ignored.** Adding a Google Drive source with a
  custom title still re-derives the display title from live Drive metadata (the client does
  send the title; the backend overrides it for native Drive imports). Call `source_rename`
  after the add if you need a specific title.

| **Chat** | `chat_ask(notebook, question?, conversation_id?, references?, source_ids?, history?, suggest_followups?)` (`references`: lite\|full; never returns the raw debug blob; `source_ids` scopes to specific sources — list, JSON-array string, or comma string; omit for all; `history`>0 also returns up to N prior `{question, answer}` pairs — omit `question` to recall only; `suggest_followups=true` also returns `suggested_prompts` (3 questions to ask — works question-less too)) · `chat_configure(notebook, chat_mode?, goal?, response_length?)` (`chat_mode`: default\|learning-guide\|concise\|detailed — a preset, mutually exclusive with `goal`/`response_length`; a **partial** custom call sets just `goal` or just `response_length` and **merges** with the current settings — the omitted field is preserved, not reset; only a bare call, no preset and neither field, is rejected) · `suggest_prompts(notebook, surface?, source_ids?, query?)` (READ_ONLY; `surface`: ask\|audio-deep-dive\|audio-brief\|audio-critique\|audio-debate\|video-explainer\|video-short\|quiz\|flashcards — returns `{title, prompt}` suggestions to steer that studio surface; `ask` (default) = chat questions) |

| **Sharing** | `share_status(notebook)` (is_public/access/share_url/shared_users; enums as string labels; `view_level` omitted — the read API can't report it; plus `max_individuals_share_limit` (the enforced collaborator cap) and `is_public_sharing_allowed` (the tenant policy gate on going public) — both `null` when the backend made no claim, so test `is_public_sharing_allowed === false` for a real denial) · `share_set_access(notebook, public?, view_level?, confirm)` (link settings; `view_level`: full\|chat, echoed back only when set; `confirm` gates public widening restricted→public) · `share_set_user(notebook, email, permission?, notify?, message?, confirm)` (upsert grant; `permission`: editor\|viewer; `notify` defaults `false`; `confirm` gates every grant) · `share_remove_user(notebook, email, confirm)` |
| **Server** | `server_info(include_account?)` — version + local auth health; `include_account=true` adds an `account` block: signed-in identity (`email`, `authuser`) plus notebook/source limits, the subscription `tier` (opaque enum, e.g. `1`=Free/`2`=Pro, `null` on legacy responses; per-tier limits in [quota-limits.md](quota-limits.md)), and global `output_language` for quota pacing + language context (`null` with `output_language_is_default: true` when the account uses NotebookLM's default rather than an explicit code; best-effort; identity is network-free from the profile, the quota fields need a live session). `email` is real account PII, returned only under this opt-in flag |

Tools that only read are annotated read-only; the destructive tools (the three `*_delete` tools plus `share_remove_user`) are annotated destructive
and require `confirm`. A host that honors MCP annotations can auto-allow the read-only calls and
gate the destructive ones.

## Troubleshooting

- **`AUTH` errors / "not authenticated".** Run `notebooklm login` (or `notebooklm -p <profile> login`)
  in a terminal, then restart the server. Check with the `server_info` tool, which reports auth health.
- **`uvx` / `uv` not found.** Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (macOS/Linux)
  or `powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"` (Windows). The desktop launcher also
  searches common install dirs beyond `PATH`.
- **Client doesn't see the tools.** Confirm the config was written (`notebooklm mcp install <client>`)
  and **restart the client** — most hosts only read MCP config at startup.
- **`Unknown tool: '<name>'` after upgrading the server.** The MCP host (claude.ai, ChatGPT, …) caches
  the tool list from when it connected, so a version upgrade that **renamed or folded** a tool leaves the
  old name callable-but-failing. **Remove and re-add the connector** to refresh it — a reconnect / re-auth
  is often *not* enough (some hosts, notably ChatGPT, keep the cached manifest across reconnects). The
  server's live manifest is correct; only *removed/renamed tools* ghost — newly-added *optional* parameters
  on existing tools forward through the stale schema and keep working. See [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#unknown-tool-from-an-mcp-host-claudeai-chatgpt--after-upgrading-the-server).
- **Wrong account.** The server binds one profile per process. Start it with `--profile <name>`, or set
  `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE`. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#multiple-accounts).
- **`RATE_LIMITED`.** NotebookLM enforces per-account quotas; the error is `retriable=true` — back off
  and retry.
