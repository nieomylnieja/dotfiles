This document is the historical record of the Tier 12 / Tier 13 refactor arc.
It exists for two audiences:

- **Maintainers** who want to understand the design intent — why the
  feature-facing `Session` boundary was rebuilt around composable
  capability Protocols rather than a single broad Protocol — and
  what tradeoffs that locked in.
- **First-party callers and test suites** that imported underscore-prefixed
  (`notebooklm._...`) internals during Tier 11 or earlier, and need
  to migrate to the new module paths.

If your code only uses the documented public API
([`docs/python-api.md`](python-api.md)), nothing changed for you — the
v0.4.1 public surface was a binding constraint on the whole arc.

## Background

Tier 12 ("middleware chain") and Tier 13 ("Session/Kernel split")
restructured the **private** core layer of `notebooklm-py`:

- **Tier 12** extracted the authed HTTP path into a composable
  middleware chain (`AuthedHttpClient` Protocol, `Middleware` Protocol,
  `RequestContext`). Tracing, metrics, drain bookkeeping, error
  injection, 429 / 5xx retry, 401 auth-refresh, and the global RPC
  concurrency semaphore moved into discrete middleware modules and
  off of the monolithic transport class.
- **Tier 13** split the `ClientCore` god-object into `Session` (the
  orchestrator) and `Kernel` (the pure transport core — owns the
  `httpx.AsyncClient` and the cookie jar). It also renamed every
  `_core_*` module out of the legacy `_core` namespace into final
  homes that later consolidated under `_runtime/`, `_middleware/`, `_chat/`,
  `_request_types`, `_transport_errors`, `_streaming_post`, `_rpc_executor`,
  and so on.
- The **capability refactor** that followed (ADR-0013) replaced the
  broad `Session` Protocol that Tier 13 originally shipped with a
  composable set of narrow capability Protocols
  (`RpcCaller`, `LoopGuard`, `OperationScopeProvider`,
  `AsyncWorkRuntime`) plus feature-local runtime Protocols
  (`ChatRuntime`, `ArtifactsRuntime`, `UploadRuntime`). Feature APIs
  now depend on the narrowest slice of capability they actually use,
  not on the orchestrator class.
  Later ADR-0014/#1327 cleanup tightened this further: the current code
  passes each concrete collaborator directly, keeps `AuthMetadata` and
  `OperationScopeProvider` local to their only consumers, and leaves only
  `Kernel`, `RpcCaller`, and `LoopGuard` in `_runtime/contracts.py`.

The public `NotebookLMClient` API — `client.notebooks.*`,
`client.sources.*`, `client.chat.*`, `client.artifacts.*`, and
friends — was preserved across all three movements.

## What changed by audience

### Downstream callers using the public API

Nothing. Every method, property, and attribute reachable through
`NotebookLMClient` at v0.4.1 still works with the same signature and
return type:

```python
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient, AuthTokens
from notebooklm.rpc import RPCMethod

async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
    await client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, url)
    result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, question)
    status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(notebook_id)
```

One additive surface from this arc was
`client.chat.save_answer_as_note(...)`, which is now the canonical
citation-rich saved-from-chat workflow. The transitional
`client.notes.create_from_chat(...)` forwarder was removed in v0.7.0.

See [`docs/stability.md`](stability.md) for the public stability
contract.

### First-party callers and test suites

Underscore-prefixed names are **not** part of the documented public
surface and may move again in future tiers. The tables below are
provided as a courtesy for first-party callers and test suites that
imported them during Tier 11 or earlier.

**Quick guidance:**

- The `notebooklm._core` compatibility shim and the
  `NotebookLMClient._core` attribute alias were both deleted in
  Phase 4 (#889). Downstream code and tests must import from the
  current owning modules documented in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Prefer the public surface — `notebooklm.NotebookLMClient`,
  `notebooklm.AuthTokens`, `notebooklm.rpc.RPCMethod`, and the
  types / exceptions re-exported from the top-level package.
- Feature APIs (`NotebooksAPI`, `SourcesAPI`, `ArtifactsAPI`,
  `ChatAPI`, `ResearchAPI`, `NotesAPI`, `MindMapsAPI`, `SharingAPI`,
  `SettingsAPI`, `LabelsAPI`)
  depend on the **narrow capability Protocols** in
  `notebooklm._runtime.contracts` (`Kernel`, `RpcCaller`,
  `LoopGuard`) or on single-consumer Protocols defined in their owning
  modules — not on the deleted concrete `Session` class and not on a
  broad `Session` Protocol.

#### Renamed modules

The Tier 12 `_core_*` module paths no longer resolve.
`import notebooklm._core_auth` (and every other row below) now
raises `ImportError`. Update your imports to the new path on the
right:

| Tier 12 path | Tier 13 path |
|---|---|
| `notebooklm._core_auth` | `notebooklm._runtime.auth` |
| `notebooklm._core_cache` | `notebooklm._conversation_cache` |
| `notebooklm._core_constants` | `notebooklm._runtime.config` |
| `notebooklm._core_cookie_persistence` | `notebooklm._cookie_persistence` |
| `notebooklm._core_drain` | `notebooklm._transport_drain` |
| `notebooklm._core_error_injection` | `notebooklm._error_injection` |
| `notebooklm._core_helpers` | `notebooklm._runtime.helpers` |
| `notebooklm._core_lifecycle` | `notebooklm._runtime.lifecycle` |
| `notebooklm._core_metrics` | `notebooklm._client_metrics` |
| `notebooklm._core_polling` | `notebooklm._polling_registry` |
| `notebooklm._core_reqid` | `notebooklm._reqid_counter` |
| `notebooklm._core_rpc` | `notebooklm._rpc_executor` |
| `notebooklm._core_transport` | `notebooklm._request_types` / `notebooklm._transport_errors` / `notebooklm._streaming_post` |

`notebooklm._core` itself has been deleted.

#### Moved and renamed symbols

The Session/Kernel split introduced new home modules for the
orchestrator and its transport collaborator. Existing helper names did
not change, only their home module did.

| Tier 12 symbol | Tier 13 home | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `notebooklm._core.ClientCore` (class) | Direct collaborators + `notebooklm._runtime.contracts` | `ClientCore` was retired. Feature APIs accept direct collaborators or the narrow shared Protocols in `notebooklm._runtime.contracts` (`Kernel`, `RpcCaller`, `LoopGuard`); the broad `Session` Protocol and `_session_contracts` module were retired — see ADR-0013. |
| `notebooklm._core.MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS` | `notebooklm._transport_errors.MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS` | No longer re-exported via `_session` or `_core`. |
| `notebooklm._core.DEFAULT_*` (timeouts, concurrency knobs) | `notebooklm._runtime.config.DEFAULT_*` | |
| `notebooklm._core.AUTH_ERROR_PATTERNS`, `notebooklm._core.is_auth_error` | `notebooklm._runtime.helpers` | |
| `notebooklm._core.ERROR_INJECT_ENV_VAR` | `notebooklm._error_injection.ERROR_INJECT_ENV_VAR` | |
| `notebooklm._core._SyntheticErrorTransport` (class) | _Removed_ | Synthetic-error substitution moved into `notebooklm._middleware.error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware`. The env-var resolver (`_get_error_injection_mode`) and startup guard (`_refuse_synthetic_error_outside_test_context`) survive in `notebooklm._error_injection`. |
| `notebooklm._core.AuthRefreshCoordinator` | `notebooklm._runtime.auth.AuthRefreshCoordinator` | Class unchanged; only the home module moved. |
| `notebooklm._core.TransportDrainTracker` | `notebooklm._transport_drain.TransportDrainTracker` | Same. |
| `notebooklm._core.ClientMetrics` | `notebooklm._client_metrics.ClientMetrics` | Same. |
| `notebooklm._core.ReqidCounter` | `notebooklm._reqid_counter.ReqidCounter` | Same. |
| `notebooklm._core.CookiePersistence` | `notebooklm._cookie_persistence.CookiePersistence` | Same. |
| `notebooklm._core.ClientLifecycle` | `notebooklm._runtime.lifecycle.ClientLifecycle` | Same. |
| `notebooklm._core.RpcExecutor` | `notebooklm._rpc_executor.RpcExecutor` | Same. |
| `notebooklm._core` authed transport helpers | `notebooklm._request_types` + `notebooklm._transport_errors` + `notebooklm._streaming_post` | The interim authed-transport Adapter and catch-all helper module were retired; request types, transport errors, and streaming POST behavior now have separate owning modules. |

#### New modules introduced by Tier 12 / 13

These modules did not exist before Tier 12 began:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `notebooklm._session_contracts` | Historical v0.5.0 home for `AuthMetadata`, `Kernel`, and the shared capability Protocols (`RpcCaller`, `LoopGuard`, `OperationScopeProvider`, `AsyncWorkRuntime`) added in the capability refactor (ADR-0013). Current home: `notebooklm._runtime.contracts`, exporting only `Kernel`, `RpcCaller`, and `LoopGuard`; `AuthMetadata` is local to `_source/upload.py`, `OperationScopeProvider` is local to `_artifact/polling.py`, and `AsyncWorkRuntime` was deleted. |
| `notebooklm._kernel` | Concrete `Kernel` transport core (owns the `httpx.AsyncClient`, exposes `post` / `cookies` / `aclose`). Located at root (`src/notebooklm/_kernel.py`), not nested. |
| `notebooklm._middleware` | Middleware chain primitives (`Middleware` Protocol, `NextCall` callable type, `RpcRequest` / `RpcResponse` envelope dataclasses, `build_chain` composer). |
| `notebooklm._middleware_tracing` | Tier 12 PR 12.3 — request tracing middleware. |
| `notebooklm._middleware_metrics` | Tier 12 PR 12.4 — metrics collection middleware. |
| `notebooklm._middleware_drain` | Tier 12 PR 12.5 — drain bookkeeping middleware. |
| `notebooklm._middleware.error_injection` | Test-only error-injection middleware. |
| `notebooklm._middleware_retry` | Tier 12 PR 12.7 — 429 / 5xx retry middleware. |
| `notebooklm._middleware_auth_refresh` | Tier 12 PR 12.8 — auth-refresh-on-401 middleware. |
| `notebooklm._middleware_semaphore` | Tier 12 PR 12.9 — global RPC concurrency cap. |
| `notebooklm._chat.transport` | Chat-domain consumer-side error mapping over the shared authed POST pipeline. Replaces the chat-side wrapper that previously lived on `_core.rpc_call`. |
| `notebooklm._transport_errors` | Terminal `Kernel.post` error mapping into transport exceptions consumed by retry/auth middleware. |
| `notebooklm._request_types` | Shared dataclasses + type aliases for authed-POST request construction: `AuthSnapshot`, `BuildRequest`, `PostBody`, and `BuildRequestResult`. |
| `notebooklm._streaming_post` | Size-capped streaming POST helper used by `Kernel.post`. |

#### Deleted symbols and changed defaults

| Symbol or default | Replacement / new behavior |
|---|---|
| `notebooklm._core._SyntheticErrorTransport` (deleted) | `notebooklm._middleware.error_injection.ErrorInjectionMiddleware` (chain-resident; mode is still resolved from `NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS` via `_error_injection._get_error_injection_mode`). |
| Strict-decode soft mode | Strict decoding is now the only mode. The legacy lenient opt-out was removed in v0.7.0; setting old lenient-decode environment toggles no longer restores legacy behavior. See [ADR-0011](adr/0011-schema-validation-policy.md). |

## Design intent

The capability refactor (ADR-0013) replaced the broad
`_session_contracts.Session` Protocol that Tier 13 originally shipped.
That Protocol had become a capability bag:

```python
class Session(Protocol):
    auth: AuthMetadata
    kernel: Kernel
    async def rpc_call(...) -> Any: ...
    async def transport_post(...) -> httpx.Response: ...
    async def next_reqid(...) -> int: ...
    def assert_bound_loop(self) -> None: ...
    def operation_scope(self, label: str) -> AbstractAsyncContextManager[None]: ...
    def register_drain_hook(self, name, hook) -> None: ...
```

That shape violated the intent of
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-session-kernel-split.md): feature APIs should not
depend on concrete `Session` internals. It also made dependencies
hard to read — most features only needed logical RPC calls, while
chat, uploads, and artifact polling needed narrower specialized
runtime slices.

### Design rules

The capability model is built on six rules:

1. Promote a capability to `_runtime/contracts.py` only when it is
   shared by more than one feature or service, except for `Kernel`,
   which is the typed transport surface of the concrete client-owned
   kernel.
2. Keep single-feature runtime needs local to the owning feature
   module.
3. Feature-facing Protocols must not advertise unrelated capabilities
   from a broad host object.
4. Prefer feature-owned collaborators over widening shared session
   contracts.
5. Remove old `core` vocabulary from touched feature APIs.
6. Do not use mixins for dependency expression. Use Protocols for
   required capabilities and collaborators / services for extracted
   behavior.

### Shared capability Protocols

`src/notebooklm/_session_contracts.py` originally ended up containing
only shared capability Protocols:

```python
class RpcCaller(Protocol):
    async def rpc_call(
        self,
        method: RPCMethod,
        params: list[Any],
        source_path: str = "/",
        allow_null: bool = False,
        _is_retry: bool = False,
        *,
        disable_internal_retries: bool = False,
        operation_variant: str | None = None,
    ) -> Any: ...


class LoopGuard(Protocol):
    def assert_bound_loop(self) -> None: ...


class OperationScopeProvider(Protocol):
    def operation_scope(self, label: str) -> AbstractAsyncContextManager[None]: ...


class AsyncWorkRuntime(LoopGuard, OperationScopeProvider, Protocol):
    """Runtime support for feature-owned async work."""
```

Current code has tightened that further: `_runtime/contracts.py`
exports `Kernel`, `RpcCaller`, and `LoopGuard`; `OperationScopeProvider`
is local to `_artifact/polling.py`; `AuthMetadata` is local to
`_source/upload.py`; `AsyncWorkRuntime` was removed.

The following were **not** globally promoted:

- `auth`, `kernel`, `transport_post(...)`, `next_reqid(...)` —
  needed only by uploads and chat respectively. They live on the
  concrete `Session` and on feature-local runtimes that consume
  them, not on a shared Protocol.
- `register_drain_hook(...)` — kept on the concrete drain collaborator
  passed into `ArtifactsAPI`, since artifact polling is the only behavior
  that registers close-time feature cleanup.

### Feature-local runtimes

For part of the migration, features that needed a specialised slice of
runtime capability declared that slice as a Protocol in the feature's
own module:

- `ChatRuntime` in `_chat.py` — `RpcCaller + LoopGuard +
  transport_post + next_reqid`. `transport_post` is consumed via
  `chat_aware_authed_post(...)` in `_chat/transport.py`.
- `ArtifactsRuntime` in `_artifacts.py` — `RpcCaller +
  AsyncWorkRuntime + DrainHookRegistration`. Artifact polling owns
  the only close-time cleanup hook in the codebase today.
- `UploadRuntime` in `_source_upload.py` — `RpcCaller +
  OperationScopeProvider + LoopGuard`. The upload pipeline also receives
  `kernel` and `auth` as constructor args, since uploads need
  upload-specific auth routing and live cookies — but those wires
  are explicit, not implicit through a god-object.

If a future feature ever needs the same local slice that another
feature has carved out, the rule is: promote the Protocol to
`_runtime/contracts.py` only when there is a real second consumer,
not on speculation.

Those composite runtime Protocols were later removed. Current
constructors take the direct collaborators they need by keyword:
`ArtifactsAPI(rpc=..., drain=..., lifecycle=...)`,
`ChatAPI(rpc=..., transport=..., reqid=..., loop_guard=...)`, and
`SourceUploadPipeline(rpc=..., drain=..., lifecycle=..., kernel=...,
auth=...)`.

### Note / mind-map service split

The capability refactor also separated note-row primitives from
mind-map product behavior. Before the split, `_mind_map.py` mixed
three responsibilities:

1. Backend row classification (note vs. mind-map vs. saved-chat).
2. Mind-map filtering and content extraction.
3. Saved-from-chat note encoding (chat citations + rich source
   passage anchors).

These were factored apart:

- **`_note_service.py`** owns the generic note row primitives:
  `fetch_note_rows`, `classify_row` (over a private `NoteRowKind`
  enum), `extract_content`, `create_note`, `update_note`,
  `delete_note`. Mind maps are stored in the same note-row
  collection that NotebookLM returns from `GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS`,
  so note-row classification is the right place to recognise them.
- **`_mind_map.py`** kept the mind-map boundary as
  `NoteBackedMindMapService` — `list_mind_maps`,
  `extract_content`, `delete_mind_map` — delegating to
  `NoteService` for the underlying row operations.
  `NotesAPI.list_mind_maps(...)` and `NotesAPI.delete_mind_map(...)`
  forward through this service, preserving their public signatures.
- **Saved-from-chat note encoding** moved out of `_mind_map.py` and
  into `_chat/notes.py`, where `ChatAPI.save_answer_as_note(...)`
  owns the workflow. `NotesAPI.create_from_chat(...)` was a deprecated
  forwarder during the migration window and was removed in v0.7.0.

`NoteRowKind` stays private — it is an internal classification of
rows returned by the undocumented `GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS` RPC, not
a public API type.

### Constructor and naming rules

Feature APIs adopted consistent dependency-naming conventions:

- Pure-RPC features store `self._rpc`. Constructor parameter is
  named `rpc: RpcCaller`.
- Features with multiple runtime needs take direct keyword-only
  collaborators and store only the fields they use.
- The old `self._core` vocabulary was removed from every touched
  feature module.
- Extra collaborators are keyword-only:

```python
SourcesAPI(rpc, *, uploader=source_uploader)
NotebooksAPI(rpc, *, sources_api=sources)
ChatAPI(rpc=rpc, transport=transport, reqid=reqid, loop_guard=lifecycle,
        notebooks=notebooks)
ArtifactsAPI(rpc=rpc, drain=drain, lifecycle=lifecycle,
             notebooks=notebooks, mind_maps=mind_maps,
             note_service=note_service)
NotesAPI(*, notes=note_service, mind_maps=mind_maps)
MindMapsAPI(rpc=rpc, mind_maps=mind_maps, artifacts=artifacts,
            notebooks=notebooks)
LabelsAPI(rpc, list_sources=sources.list)
```

Compatibility aliases and fallback constructors that read missing
collaborators off a broad session were removed — every feature now
requires its dependencies explicitly. `_client_assembly.py::_assemble_client`
is the single wiring root that hands them out.

## How it landed

The refactor arc shipped in four phases against the
`refactor-completion-plan` series (PRs in the #84x–#92x range).
Detailed phase notes live in the merged PR descriptions; the
high-level shape was:

- **Phase 1 — additive contracts.** New capability Protocols
  (`RpcCaller`, `LoopGuard`, `OperationScopeProvider`,
  `AsyncWorkRuntime`) were added to `_session_contracts.py`
  alongside the existing broad `Session` Protocol. Nothing was
  removed. Build stayed green.
- **Phase 2 — pure-RPC feature retyping.** `NotebooksAPI`,
  `ResearchAPI`, `SettingsAPI`, `SharingAPI` were retyped to
  `RpcCaller`, with `self._core` renamed to `self._rpc`. The
  `FakeSession` test fixture shrunk in the same commits to match
  the narrower contract.
- **Phase 3 — feature-local runtimes.** `ChatRuntime`,
  `ArtifactsRuntime`, and `UploadRuntime` were introduced in their
  owning modules. `ChatAPI`, `ArtifactsAPI`, `SourcesAPI`, and
  `SourceUploadPipeline` migrated to the new local Protocols.
  Compatibility fallbacks (the `drain_hooks=None -> session`
  fallback in `ArtifactsAPI`, the `session.kernel` / `session.auth`
  / `record_upload_queue_wait` fallbacks in `SourcesAPI`, the
  `core=` alias on `ChatAPI`) were removed in the same commits
  that updated their direct-construction test sites.
- **Phase 4 — note / mind-map split + capability cleanup.**
  `NoteService` and `NoteBackedMindMapService` were introduced,
  artifact generation and download paths were rewired through them,
  `ChatAPI.save_answer_as_note(...)` was added, and
  `NotesAPI.create_from_chat(...)` was converted to a deprecated
  forwarder (later removed in v0.7.0). The module-level `_mind_map`
  wrappers were removed.
  The broad `Session` Protocol was deleted from
  `_session_contracts.py`, along with the broad `FakeSession`
  defaults shape and the broad-Protocol test pin. The `_core.py`
  compatibility shim and the `NotebookLMClient._core` attribute
  alias were both removed in this phase (#889).

Implementation tactics — line-number-specific constructor changes,
the ordering rules for compatibility-fallback removals, the
`_source_upload.py` local `RpcCaller` → `RpcCallback` rename to
avoid name collision with the new shared Protocol — are recorded in
the merged PR descriptions, not in this document. The post-refactor
runtime shape is canonicalized in [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md).
