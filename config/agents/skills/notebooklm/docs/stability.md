# API Stability and Versioning

**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-04

This document describes the stability guarantees and versioning policy for `notebooklm-py`.

## Important Context

This library uses **undocumented Google APIs**. Unlike official Google APIs, there are:

- **No stability guarantees from Google**
- **No deprecation notices** before changes
- **No SLAs or support**

Google can change the underlying APIs at any time, which may break this library without warning.

## Versioning Policy

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with modifications for our unique situation:

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

| Change Type | Version Bump | Example |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| RPC method ID fixes (Google changed something) | PATCH | 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 |
| Bug fixes | PATCH | 0.1.1 → 0.1.2 |
| New features (backward compatible) | MINOR | 0.1.2 → 0.2.0 |
| Public API breaking changes | MAJOR | 0.2.0 → 1.0.0 |

### Special Considerations

1. **RPC ID Changes = Patch Release**
   - When Google changes internal RPC method IDs, we release a patch
   - These are "bug fixes" from our perspective, not breaking changes
   - Users should always use the latest patch version

2. **Python API Stability**
   - Public API (items in `__all__`) is stable within a major version
   - Breaking changes require a major version bump
   - Deprecated APIs are marked with `DeprecationWarning` and documented

3. **0.x Pre-1.0 Semantics**
   - Per [SemVer §4](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4), the project is currently in 0.x and the public API is not yet considered stable.
   - **MINOR** releases (e.g. 0.4.0 → 0.5.0) **may remove** previously deprecated public APIs. Removal is preceded by at least one MINOR release of `DeprecationWarning` notice.
   - Once the project reaches 1.0.0, breaking changes will require a **MAJOR** bump as described above.

## Public API Surface

The following are considered **public API** and are subject to stability guarantees:

### Stable (Won't break without major version bump)

```python
# Version
__version__               # Package version string (read-only)

# Client

NotebookLMClient.chat
NotebookLMClient.research
NotebookLMClient.notes
NotebookLMClient.settings

# Exceptions (all inherit from NotebookLMError)
NotebookLMError                    # Base exception
NotFoundError                      # Cross-domain umbrella for *NotFoundError

RPCError, AuthError, RateLimitError, RPCTimeoutError, ServerError
NetworkError, DecodingError, UnknownRPCMethodError
ClientError, ConfigurationError, ValidationError
# Domain-specific
# Note: *NotFoundError classes mix in RPCError (catchable as either RPCError
# or the domain base). v0.6.0 restored this symmetry across all three "not
# found" types — see docs/python-api.md#error-handling for migration prose.
# Note: *TimeoutError classes mix in WaitTimeoutError (and the built-in
# TimeoutError). v0.7.0 added the WaitTimeoutError umbrella so `except
# WaitTimeoutError` catches source/artifact/research wait timeouts uniformly,
# while `except TimeoutError` keeps working — see docs/python-api.md#waittimeouterror.

```

### Internal helpers exported for compatibility

The following symbols appear in `notebooklm/__all__` so that downstream code can
import them via `from notebooklm import ...`, but they are **not** covered by
the stability guarantee above. They support narrow integration use cases
(typed exception handling and warning filters) and may be
renamed, narrowed, or removed in a future minor release. Prefer the stable
surface when possible.

```python
CitedSourceSelection      # Chat citation payload — internal shape, exposed for typing
AuthExtractionError       # Specialized AuthError raised by browser-based login
NotebookLimitError        # Raised when account notebook quota is exhausted
UnknownTypeWarning        # Warning category emitted when .kind falls back to UNKNOWN
```

### Internal (May change without notice)

```python
# These are NOT part of the public API:
notebooklm.rpc.*          # RPC protocol internals, except documented power-user imports
notebooklm._*.py          # All underscore-prefixed modules
notebooklm.auth.*         # Auth internals (except documented AuthTokens, cookie conversion, and cookie-domain constants)
```

For raw-RPC power-user calls, import the documented RPC helpers explicitly:
```python
from notebooklm.rpc import RPCMethod, resolve_rpc_id
```

### Adapter surfaces: MCP server and REST API (experimental)

The **MCP tool surface** (`mcp` extra, `notebooklm-mcp`) and the **single-tenant
REST API** (`server` extra, `notebooklm-server`) are transport adapters over the
same `_app/` business logic as the CLI. They are **experimental and not covered
by the semver guarantees above** — tool/route names, parameters, and response
shapes may change between releases without a major-version bump. The underlying
Python client API they call is still governed by the stability policy; only the
adapter surfaces are exempt. The remote-MCP connector (HTTP transport,
self-hosted OAuth, Docker/Cloudflare/Tailscale deployment) is likewise
experimental.

### Strict decoding (the only mode since v0.7.0)

Schema-drift helpers (notably the internal ``safe_index`` decode helper) **raise**
:class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.UnknownRPCMethodError` when Google's
batchexecute response shape does not match what the decoder expects. This is
now the only behavior: the legacy ``NOTEBOOKLM_STRICT_DECODE=0`` warn-and-
return-``None`` opt-out was retired in v0.7.0 (it had a one-release
``DeprecationWarning`` window through v0.5.0/v0.6.0). The env var is now
ignored.

Stability implications:

- **Exception type is stable.** ``UnknownRPCMethodError`` is a subclass of
  ``DecodingError`` and ``RPCError`` (both public-API exceptions). Code that
  already catches ``RPCError`` continues to handle drift correctly.
- **No silent shape changes.** Methods that previously returned ``None`` /
  empty values on drift now raise. Callers that treated ``None`` as a valid
  sentinel must add an ``except UnknownRPCMethodError`` branch.

See [`docs/configuration.md#decoder-strictness`](configuration.md#decoder-strictness)
for the env-var contract and
[`docs/adr/0011-schema-validation-policy.md`](adr/0011-schema-validation-policy.md)
for the design rationale behind the strict-decode policy.

## Deprecation Policy

1. **Deprecation Notice**: Deprecated features emit `DeprecationWarning`
2. **Documentation**: Deprecations are noted in docstrings and CHANGELOG
3. **Removal Timeline**: Deprecated features are removed in the next major version. While the project is in 0.x, removal may instead occur in the next MINOR release after at least one MINOR cycle of `DeprecationWarning` (see "0.x Pre-1.0 Semantics" above).
4. **Migration Guide**: Breaking changes include migration instructions

### Currently Deprecated

See [`docs/deprecations.md`](deprecations.md) for the canonical list of
currently-deprecated APIs and their scheduled removal versions, plus the
deprecations removed in v0.6.0, v0.7.0, and v0.8.0.

### Removed in v0.5.0

The following v0.3-era deprecations completed their removal cycle in v0.5.0:

| Removed | Replacement | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `Source.source_type` | `Source.kind` | Returns `SourceType` str enum |
| `Artifact.artifact_type` | `Artifact.kind` | Returns `ArtifactType` str enum |
| `Artifact.variant` | `Artifact.kind` | Use `.is_quiz` / `.is_flashcards` |
| `SourceFulltext.source_type` | `SourceFulltext.kind` | Returns `SourceType` str enum |
| `notebooklm.StudioContentType` | `ArtifactType` | Str enum for user-facing code |
| `notebooklm.DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH` | `notebooklm.paths.get_storage_path()` | Module-level constant replaced by helper |
| `notebooklm.rpc.types.StudioContentType` | `ArtifactType` | Internal raw code alias removed |
| `notebooklm.rpc.StudioContentType` | `ArtifactType` | Internal re-export removed |
| `notebooklm.rpc.RPCMethod.DISCOVER_SOURCES` | none | Unused raw RPC enum member, not exercised by client APIs |
| `notebooklm.rpc.RPCMethod.QUERY_ENDPOINT` | `notebooklm.rpc.get_query_url()` (internal) | Endpoint URL path moved out of the RPC method enum; `get_query_url()` is itself internal plumbing (`notebooklm.rpc.*` is internal — see above) with no blessed public replacement |
| `notebooklm.cli.language_cmd.save_config` | `_save_config` | Private low-level write primitive only |

### Deprecated for a future major release

| Deprecated | Replacement | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Awaiting `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` | `async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:` | Emits `DeprecationWarning`; scheduled for v1.0 removal |

### Permanent aliases

`RPCError.rpc_id` and `RPCError.code` are permanent backward-compatibility
aliases for `RPCError.method_id` and `RPCError.rpc_code`. Exception diagnostic
aliases are exempt from the standard deprecation cycle because removal can mask
the original exception inside `except` handlers. New code should prefer the
canonical attribute names, but existing exception handlers may keep using the
aliases.

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from v0.3.x to v0.4.0

Version 0.4.0 is backward compatible with v0.3.x. Notable additions:

- **Multi-account profiles** - Existing single-account setups continue to work as the implicit default profile. Your existing `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json` is auto-detected — no manual migration is required. New accounts can be added via `notebooklm profile create <name>`.
- **`[cookies]` optional extra** - To reuse cookies from your existing browser, install with `pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"` (requires `rookiepy`; full extras matrix: [docs/installation.md#optional-extras-matrix](installation.md#optional-extras-matrix)).
- **Deprecation removal deferred** - The deprecated attributes originally scheduled for v0.4.0 (`Source.source_type`, `Artifact.artifact_type`, `Artifact.variant`, `SourceFulltext.source_type`, `StudioContentType`, `DEFAULT_STORAGE_PATH`) were deferred to v0.5.0. In v0.5.0 and later, use the replacements listed in [Removed in v0.5.0](#removed-in-v050).

### Migrating from v0.2.x to v0.3.0

Version 0.3.0 introduced attributes that were deprecated until their v0.5.0
removal. The historical migration examples below show the replacement surface.

#### 1. `Source.source_type` → `Source.kind`

**Before (removed in v0.5.0):**
```python
source = (await client.sources.list(notebook_id))[0]
if source.source_type == "pdf":
    print("This is a PDF")
```

**After (recommended):**
```python
from notebooklm import SourceType

source = (await client.sources.list(notebook_id))[0]

# Option 1: Use enum comparison (recommended)
if source.kind == SourceType.PDF:
    print("This is a PDF")

# Option 2: Use string comparison (str enum supports this)
if source.kind == "pdf":
    print("This is a PDF")
```

**Available `SourceType` values:**
`GOOGLE_DOCS`, `GOOGLE_SLIDES`, `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET`, `PDF`, `PASTED_TEXT`, `WEB_PAGE`, `YOUTUBE`, `MARKDOWN`, `DOCX`, `CSV`, `IMAGE`, `MEDIA`, `UNKNOWN`

#### 2. `Artifact.artifact_type` → `Artifact.kind`

**Before (removed in v0.5.0):**
```python
artifact = (await client.artifacts.list(notebook_id))[0]
if artifact.artifact_type == 1:
    print("This is an audio artifact")
```

**After (recommended):**
```python
from notebooklm import ArtifactType

artifact = (await client.artifacts.list(notebook_id))[0]

# Option 1: Use enum comparison (recommended)
if artifact.kind == ArtifactType.AUDIO:
    print("This is an audio artifact")

# Option 2: Use string comparison (str enum supports this)
if artifact.kind == "audio":
    print("This is an audio artifact")
```

**Available `ArtifactType` values:**
`AUDIO`, `VIDEO`, `REPORT`, `QUIZ`, `FLASHCARDS`, `MIND_MAP`, `INFOGRAPHIC`, `SLIDE_DECK`, `DATA_TABLE`, `UNKNOWN`

#### 3. `Artifact.variant` → `Artifact.kind` or helpers

**Before (removed in v0.5.0):**
```python
if artifact.artifact_type == 4 and artifact.variant == 2:
    print("This is a quiz")
```

**After (recommended):**
```python
# Option 1: Use .kind
if artifact.kind == ArtifactType.QUIZ:
    print("This is a quiz")

# Option 2: Use helper properties
if artifact.is_quiz:
    print("This is a quiz")
if artifact.is_flashcards:
    print("These are flashcards")
```

#### Why These Changes?

1. **Stability**: The `.kind` property abstracts internal integer codes that Google may change
2. **Usability**: String enums work in comparisons, logging, and serialization
3. **Future-proofing**: Unknown types return `UNKNOWN` with a warning instead of crashing

## What Happens When Google Breaks Things

When Google changes their internal APIs:

1. **Detection**: Automated RPC health check runs nightly for `main`; release
   branch checks run manually during release prep (see below)
2. **Investigation**: Identify changed method IDs using browser devtools
3. **Fix**: Update `rpc/types.py` with new method IDs
4. **Release**: Push patch release as soon as possible

### Automated RPC Health Check

A nightly GitHub Action (`rpc-health.yml`) monitors all 35+ RPC methods for ID
changes on `main`. Release branches use the same workflow through manual
dispatch.

**What it verifies:**
- The RPC method ID we send matches the ID returned in the response envelope
- Example: `LIST_NOTEBOOKS` sends `wXbhsf` → response must contain `wXbhsf`

**What it does NOT verify:**
- Response data correctness (E2E tests cover this)
- Response schema validation (too fragile across 35+ methods)
- Business logic (out of scope for monitoring)

**Why this design:**
- Google's breaking change pattern is silent ID changes, not schema changes
- Error responses still contain the method ID, so we detect mismatches even on API errors
- A mismatch means `rpc/types.py` needs updating, triggering a patch release

**On mismatch detection:**
- GitHub Issue auto-created with `bug`, `rpc-breakage`, and `automated` labels
- Report shows expected vs actual IDs and which `RPCMethod` entries need updating

**Manual trigger:** `gh workflow run rpc-health.yml -f custom_branch=release/vX.Y.Z`

### How to Report API Breakage

1. Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues) for existing reports
2. If not reported, open an issue with:
   - Error message (especially any RPC error codes)
   - Which operation failed
   - When it started failing
3. See [RPC Development Guide](rpc-development.md) for debugging

### Self-Recovery

If the library breaks before we release a fix:

1. Open browser devtools on NotebookLM
2. Perform the failing operation manually
3. Find the new RPC method ID in Network tab
4. Temporarily override the rotated ID without mutating the enum:
   ```bash
   export NOTEBOOKLM_RPC_OVERRIDES='{"LIST_NOTEBOOKS": "NewMethodId"}'
   ```

   The override key is the `RPCMethod` enum name. See
   [configuration.md#environment-variables](configuration.md#environment-variables)
   for validation and host-allowlist behavior.

## Upgrade Recommendations

### Stay Current

```bash
# Always use latest patch version
pip install --upgrade notebooklm-py
```

### Pin Appropriately

```toml
# pyproject.toml - recommended
dependencies = [
    "notebooklm-py>=0.1,<1.0",  # Accept patches and minors
]

# requirements.txt - for reproducibility
notebooklm-py==0.1.0  # Exact version (but update regularly!)
```

### Test Before Upgrading

```bash
# Test in development first
pip install notebooklm-py==X.Y.Z
pytest
```
