## TL;DR

NotebookLM has no public OAuth surface. The library authenticates by carrying
Google session cookies (`SID`, `__Secure-1PSID`, `__Secure-1PSIDTS`, `OSID`, and
friends) extracted from a real browser sign-in. Two clocks govern their validity:

- **`__Secure-1PSIDTS` has a *recommended* rotation cadence of ~600 s**
  (self-reported by Google as `["identity.hfcr",600]` on the `RotateCookies`
  response). This is a *hint*, not a hard rejection TTL — but see §2.5: once a
  newer value has been issued, the **superseded** one is now rejected within
  roughly half an hour. The "hours to days" figure below applies only while no
  other client has rotated the session out from under you; a copied snapshot
  does not qualify. Worst-case profiles (datacenter egress, cross-IP, Workspace
  policy, incomplete extraction) collapse it further.
- **`SID` and `__Secure-1PSID`** have very long server-side lifetimes (months to
  years) and effectively don't expire under normal usage.
- **Cookie set completeness matters more than freshness.** Google rejects cookie
  sets missing `__Secure-1PSIDTS` together with any one other cookie, even though
  removing `__Secure-1PSIDTS` alone is recoverable — see
  [§3.3](#33-empirical-cookie-requirements).

A long-lived client must therefore drive `*PSIDTS` rotation itself. The cleanest
mechanism is a direct `POST` to `https://accounts.google.com/RotateCookies` —
Google's dedicated unsigned rotation endpoint, the **L1** primitive at the bottom
of a tiered recovery design that escalates as failure modes get harder.

The built-in MCP and REST servers enable a 600-second L2 keepalive for their
process-lifetime client. On a mid-session rejection, any file-backed client also
performs a network-free reload of a different valid `storage_state.json` before
escalating. That retry lets a long-lived process consume a session a CLI or
sibling server has already refreshed. The selected sample's cookies and in-band
account route advance together, so a sibling login that changes accounts also
reroutes the immediate retry and subsequent RPCs; an account-only rewrite is not
mistaken for an unchanged profile. A cleared/default route is recorded in-band,
so legacy `context.json` fallback cannot cross the primary-file commit-to-scrub
window. The reload is skipped for inline auth,
invalid storage, and a profile identical to the live session. It adopts the
exact disk sample as the next persistence baseline only if the profile has not
advanced again, and it never overwrites a live jar that changed while the file
read was in flight. The file-backed bridge is bounded: it can try one changed
live jar, force-sample disk while preserving one newer authentication-bearing
live candidate, then use one final disk sample if that candidate is rejected.

The recovery ladder runs cheapest-to-heaviest — **L1** per-call `RotateCookies`
POST, **L2** background keepalive, **L3** headless re-auth / loopback CDP, **L4**
master-token re-mint, **L5** `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` (which, when configured,
runs *before* L3/L4 on a **cold start** — rung "L2.5" in the code's escalation
order, see [ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)), **L6** manual `notebooklm
login`, **L7** scheduled `notebooklm auth refresh` (the same taxonomy as
[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md#authentication-errors); per-layer detail in
[§4](#4--the-recovery-ladder)). L1/L2 keep a live session fresh but can't revive a
dead one; L3 needs the profile's browser session still alive; **L4 is the only
fully-automatic layer that revives a fully-expired session with no browser.**

**L4 (master-token re-mint) is the standout for headless/unattended use.** Unlike
L3 it needs no browser at refresh time, and unlike L5/L6 it is fully automatic.
One durable master token — one human sign-in, then good for months — re-mints web
cookies on demand and self-heals an expired session in-process, coalesced across
event loops **within one process** through the `single_flight` core
([ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)) — re-mint rungs deliberately take
no cross-process flock, so concurrent processes each still re-mint their own
session (unlike the L5 refresh-cmd rung, §6.2, which is cross-process
serialized); live mid-session RPCs keep their own, deliberately untouched
`AuthRefreshCoordinator` single-flight. See
[§4.4](#44-l4--master-token-re-mint) and
[ADR-0023](adr/0023-master-token-headless-auth.md).

`NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` ([#336](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/336))
is a complementary, reactive hook: it runs a user-supplied recovery command on
auth-expiry signals, then retries the token fetch once. It is **orthogonal to
L1–L4** — those proactively keep the session fresh or re-mint it in-process, while
`NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` is the "we lost the session anyway, run my recovery
script" lever. See [§6.2](#62-notebooklm_refresh_cmdcommand-line-l5).

L1 works today on every account type tested. Long-running Python workers should
add L2; MCP and REST servers already enable it. Unattended/headless/server/CI
deployments should adopt L4; idle profiles between processes can add L7. If
Google extends DBSC enforcement to non-Chrome cookie paths, L3's CDP arm becomes
the primary browser-backed recovery path.

## Available auth methods

There are five ways to give the library credentials. Pick by deployment shape;
they compose (e.g. `--master-token` for the durable credential plus
`NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` as a belt-and-suspenders reactive hook).

| Method | Command / env | Best for | Survives cookie expiry unattended? | Setup cost |
|---|---|---|:-:|---|
| **(a) Interactive login** | `notebooklm login` (Playwright Google sign-in into a private Chromium profile) | Desktop / interactive use | No — re-login when prompted | Low (one browser sign-in) |
| **(b) Browser-cookie reuse** | `notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser>` (rookiepy extraction from an existing profile) | Reusing a browser you already sign into | Only while the source browser session stays alive; pairs with L7 cron | Low (no interaction) |
| **(c) Master token** ⭐ | `notebooklm login --master-token` (`[headless]` extra; durable token, headless L4 re-mint) | **Servers / CI / unattended / headless** | **Yes** — re-mints automatically, no browser | Medium (one bootstrap sign-in, ship `master_token.json`) |
| **(d) Inline auth JSON** | `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON=<storage_state payload>` | CI / ephemeral containers with no on-disk profile | No — env-var auth has no writeable file, so L3/L4 decline | Low (paste a secret) |
| **(e) External refresh hook** | `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD=<command>` | Custom recovery (CookieCloud pull, browser re-extract) layered on any of the above | Depends on the script | Medium (write + secure a script) |

Notes: **(c) is the recommended default for long-lived headless use** — the only
method that both survives full cookie expiry *and* needs no browser at refresh
time. **(d) `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`** carries a full `storage_state.json` payload
inline (credential-equivalent) with no backing file, so the file-backed recovery
layers (L3/L4) decline — good for short-lived CI jobs, but pair with (c) or (e) for
anything long-running. **(e) `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`** is not a credential source
on its own; it is the reactive hook that fires after auth has already expired
([§6.2](#62-notebooklm_refresh_cmdcommand-line-l5)).

## Recommended setup

### Interactive desktop user

Just `notebooklm login`. The Playwright Chromium flow handles it; re-login when
prompted (typically days to weeks between prompts).

### Long-lived in-process client (agent, MCP server, worker)

```python
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(keepalive=600) as client:
    ...
```

L1 fires on `from_storage()`; L2 fires every 600 s while the client is open. This
keeps `*PSIDTS` rotating for as long as the process lives.

### Unattended / headless / server / CI — use the master token (L4)

This is the recommended path. No browser at refresh time, survives full cookie
expiry, and no `storage_state.json` to keep re-shipping.

1. `pip install "notebooklm-py[headless]"`.
2. One-time, on a machine with a browser (dedicated / throwaway account):
   `notebooklm -p <profile> login --master-token --account you@gmail.com`.
3. Ship the bootstrapped profile — **both** `master_token.json` and the
   `storage_state.json` the bootstrap just minted (each `0600`) — to the server.
   (A clean server with *only* `master_token.json` and no `storage_state.json`
   needs one `notebooklm -p <profile> auth refresh` to mint and passively
   validate the initial cookies; shipping both skips that step.)
4. Run commands normally. Cookies are minted on bootstrap and **re-minted
   automatically** when the session dies (L4, [§4.4](#44-l4--master-token-re-mint));
   request conditional recovery with `notebooklm -p <profile> auth refresh`, or
   use the legacy forced route
   `notebooklm -p <profile> login --master-token-refresh` when specifically needed.

Caveats: the master token is a full-account, infostealer-grade credential — use a
dedicated account, keep the file `0600`, never log or commit it. One account is
**single-consumer**: N workers re-minting concurrently can invalidate each other's
`SID`. The master token inherits the standing DBSC risk (server-minted cookies
could be rejected if enforcement extends to this path), but re-mint is itself the
mitigation while it isn't enforced. See
[ADR-0023](adr/0023-master-token-headless-auth.md) and
[installation.md#d-headless-server-or-ci](installation.md#d-headless-server-or-ci).

### Unattended without the `[headless]` extra — browser-cookie extract + cron

If you can't or won't use a master token, extract from a real browser and refresh
on a schedule:

1. Sign in to NotebookLM once in Firefox (or any rookiepy-supported browser).
2. `notebooklm -p <profile> login --browser-cookies firefox`.
3. Schedule L7: `7,27,47 */1 * * * notebooklm --profile <profile> auth refresh`
   (off-minute schedule avoids fleet collision).
4. Keeping the source browser running with a Google tab adds resilience, but even
   a closed browser works for hours-to-days while `RotateCookies` keeps
   succeeding from `SID` alone — provided this is the only client using the
   session. A second client rotating the same session supersedes your value;
   see §2.5.

### Workspace / Enterprise with admin session-binding

Currently **not supported.** Admin-policy session binding is a Workspace beta that
requires DBSC-compatible flows. Request an exemption from your admin or use a
personal Google account for automation.

## 1 · Problem statement

NotebookLM uses Google's internal `batchexecute` RPC. There is no documented API
key, no OAuth scope, no service account path. Every project that automates
NotebookLM does so with **scraped session cookies** from a logged-in browser. The
library exposes those via `notebooklm login` (Playwright-driven Google sign-in
into a private Chromium profile) and `notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser>`
(rookiepy-driven extraction from an existing profile). Both produce a
`storage_state.json` that authenticates every subsequent RPC.

The keepalive question is: **what keeps `storage_state.json` valid between
user-driven re-authentications?** The naïve "cookies have expiry timestamps; trust
them" answer is wrong on two counts: the most consequential cookie
(`__Secure-1PSIDTS`) has a server-side recommended rotation cadence not encoded in
its `Expires` attribute (the on-disk `Expires` is irrelevant to server-side
validity), and even cookies with a year-long `Expires` are **revoked early by
Google's risk model** when the access pattern looks unusual (no JS, no fingerprint,
IP changes, long idle gaps). So the library must actively refresh.

---

## 2 · Background: Google session auth, rotation, and DBSC

Vocabulary the rest of the doc uses. Skip to [§3](#3--threat-model) if you've
already spent time inside Google's identity surface.

### 2.1 The cookie taxonomy

Google authenticates a browser session with a **family of ~15 cookies**, not a
single bearer token. Each cookie has a distinct role; the family is designed so
revoking or rotating any one slot doesn't invalidate the others. The set is shared
across `*.google.com` properties — Search, Drive, Gmail, NotebookLM, YouTube,
Workspace — which is why a sign-in to any one produces auth artifacts the rest of
the ecosystem accepts.

Naming conventions:

- **`__Secure-` prefix.** The cookie's `Secure` attribute must be set, so it's
  never sent over plaintext HTTP. Google sets this on every meaningful auth cookie.
- **`__Host-` prefix.** Stricter: the cookie must also set `Path=/`, must not set
  `Domain=` (pinned to the exact issuing origin), and must be `Secure`. Used for
  the most scope-sensitive cookies (`__Host-GAPS`, `__Host-1PLSID`, …).
- **`1P` vs `3P`.** First-party vs third-party context. `__Secure-1PSID` is used
  when the request originates from a `*.google.com` page; `__Secure-3PSID` is the
  variant Google sends on third-party pages that embed Google content. They rotate
  independently. We typically need both because intermediate rotation redirects
  cross the 1P/3P boundary.
- **`*SID` / `*SIDTS` / `*SIDCC`.** Three cookie *families* that separate
  **identity** (who you are, slow to change) from **freshness** (you're using the
  session right now, fast to expire):

  | Family | Role | Recommended rotation cadence | Stale-value validity |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `*SID` (`SID`, `HSID`, `SSID`, `APISID`, `SAPISID`, …) | Long-lived identity | Months → ~1 year | Practically never expires for active accounts |
  | `*SIDTS` (`__Secure-1PSIDTS`, `__Secure-3PSIDTS`) | Rotating freshness partner of `*SID` | **~600 s** (Google's self-report) | Hours-to-days on a stable IP / non-Workspace profile |
  | `*SIDCC` (`SIDCC`, `__Secure-1PSIDCC`, …) | Per-request "session continuity check" | Issued on every request | Not enforced for accept/reject |

A few cookies sit outside this taxonomy:

- **`OSID`, `__Secure-OSID`** — per-product session, set on `notebooklm.google.com`
  and `myaccount.google.com`. Re-issued on each sign-in.
- **`LSID`, `__Host-1PLSID`, `__Host-3PLSID`** — identity-service cookies on
  `accounts.google.com`. Long-lived.
- **`__Host-GAPS`** — anti-takeover binding cookie. Long-lived; part of how Google
  detects suspicious cross-device reuse.

The library treats these uniformly: extract the full set at sign-in, persist them
in `storage_state.json`, replay them on every RPC.
`_is_allowed_cookie_domain` (in `_auth/cookie_policy.py`, re-exported through
`auth.py`) gates which `Set-Cookie` headers from a redirect chain are worth
keeping, matching against `ALLOWED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` plus the regional
`google.<cctld>` set.

### 2.2 How cookie rotation works

"Rotation" means: the server periodically issues a new value for a short-lived
cookie (`Set-Cookie: __Secure-1PSIDTS=<fresh>; …`), and the browser is expected to
overwrite its on-disk copy. If the client falls behind, the server eventually
stops accepting the old value and the session is dead until re-auth.

Two clocks run in parallel:

- The **identity clock** (`*SID`) ticks in months. Google extends it silently as
  long as it sees activity; for a daily-active user it effectively never expires.
- The **freshness clock** (`*PSIDTS`) has a recommended rotation cadence of ~600 s,
  self-reported in the `RotateCookies` response body as `["identity.hfcr",600]`
  (`hfcr` = "high-frequency cookie rotation"; `600` = seconds). This is a rotation
  *hint*, not a hard expiration: stale values keep working for hours or days
  depending on server-side state, but long-idle sessions eventually drift into
  sign-in redirects.

Rotation is **server-driven**: the client posts to a rotation endpoint; the server
inspects the existing `*SID` (and optionally a DBSC proof — see §2.3) and returns a
fresh `*PSIDTS`. The client only chooses *when* to fire.

**Crucially: pure RPC traffic against `notebooklm.google.com` does not trigger
rotation.** `batchexecute` accepts the existing cookies, but Google only mints a
fresh `*PSIDTS` when something talks to the *identity* surface (`accounts.google.com`,
the NotebookLM homepage GET, the `RotateCookies` POST). A client that only calls
`batchexecute` silently drifts past the rotation window and starts failing — exactly
what L1/L2 target. We use `RotateCookies` because it rotates deterministically for
both browser-bound and Firefox-extracted sessions (see
[Appendix](#appendix-field-notes--historical-findings)).

### 2.3 Device-Bound Session Credentials (DBSC)

DBSC is Google's response to **infostealer cookie theft**: malware exfiltrates the
cookie jar and an attacker replays it from another machine. DBSC binds a session to
**a private key in tamper-resistant hardware** (TPM / Secure Enclave / Strongbox) on
the original device — the browser generates a non-extractable keypair at sign-in and
registers the public key, then signs a server nonce on every rotation. The enforcing
endpoint is **`accounts.google.com/RotateBoundCookies`**, the bound-cookie analog of
the unsigned `RotateCookies` we use; an attacker who steals the jar can't sign the
next bound rotation, so the stolen session dies instead of renewing. The
[W3C spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-dbsc/) is deliberately structured so only
hardware-attesting browsers can implement it — no Python HTTP client can, and no
public OSS DBSC client exists outside Chrome (see [A3](#a3--ruled-out-experiments)).

**Current enforcement state.** DBSC is rolling out. Enforcement currently targets
**Chrome itself** — Chrome refuses to use cookies that weren't bound at sign-in,
even on the same machine. Non-Chrome HTTP clients (httpx, curl, Firefox) can still
hit the legacy unsigned `RotateCookies` endpoint without a DBSC proof, so every
HTTP-only strategy in this document works today. The day Google extends enforcement
to that endpoint, they break together; the in-tree escape is to parasitize a real
DBSC-enrolled Chrome session through the L3 CDP attach arm, or to source cookies
via an operator-provided `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` (e.g. CookieCloud federation).
See [§7 canaries](#7--canaries-and-signals) for the tripwires that would signal the
transition.

### 2.4 How browser-cookie extraction works

`notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser>` reads cookies directly out of an
installed browser's profile rather than minting fresh ones via Playwright. It is a
**variant of manual login (L6)** and a common backing command for
`NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` (L5) — it is **not** a recovery layer of its own, and in
particular it is not L4 (L4 is the master token).

Browsers store cookies in encrypted SQLite databases, with the decryption key in the
OS credential store (Keychain / DPAPI / libsecret). **Chrome 127+ adds App-Bound
Encryption (ABE)** — a second layer bound to Chrome's signed binary that defeats
user-space readers; `browser_cookie3` doesn't handle it and `rookiepy` needs admin
from Chrome 130+ ([rookie#50](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/rookie/issues/50)).
**Firefox has no ABE** (Mozilla treats local file-access attackers as out-of-scope),
so its cookies stay readable by any user-space process — hence the Windows Firefox
recommendation. The library uses `rookiepy` (~16 browsers) and reshapes the result
via `_auth/cookies.py::convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state` into a
Playwright-compatible `storage_state.json`, indistinguishable downstream from a
Playwright-minted one. Extraction asks for the full multi-domain set
(`ALLOWED_COOKIE_DOMAINS + GOOGLE_REGIONAL_CCTLDS`) because dropping any one breaks
specific paths (e.g. losing `.notebooklm.google.com` cookies breaks artifact
downloads).

### 2.5 Four timers people confuse

| Timer | Magnitude | Lives in | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`*PSIDTS` rotation cadence** | ~600 s | Google's identity surface | Recommended active-client refresh interval, advertised in the `RotateCookies` response body as `["identity.hfcr",600]`. Re-measured 2026-08-05: still 600. |
| **`*PSIDTS` supersede grace** | **short, and not ours to set** | Google's identity surface | How long a *superseded* value keeps working after a newer one is issued. Undocumented, server-side, and observed to have tightened sharply — see the warning below. |
| **`*SIDCC` sliding window** | ~5 min | Google's RPC surface | A different cookie family; rotates on nearly every request; not load-bearing for our auth. |
| **Client-side rotation throttle** | 60 s | `_auth/keepalive.py` | Don't fire two `RotateCookies` POSTs within a minute (avoids 429). Unrelated to how often Google *requires* rotation. |

> **The supersede grace collapsed (observed 2026-08).** This document used to
> assert that "prior values stay valid much longer on stable profiles," and that
> reports of faster expiry trace to a risk-flagged session (§3.1) rather than a

> * **Any other active client kills your copy.** At a 600 s cadence, a

> The durable answer is a credential that does not rotate: ship

> all.

### 2.6 Domain tiering: REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL cookie domains

Not every Google cookie a logged-in browser holds is load-bearing for NotebookLM.
The library splits the cookie-source domain list into two tiers
(`_auth/cookie_policy.py`):

| Tier | Constant | Domains | Extracted by default |
|---|---|---|:-:|
| **REQUIRED** | `REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS` | `.google.com`, `notebooklm.google.com` (+ regional ccTLDs), `accounts.google.com`, `.googleusercontent.com`, `drive.google.com` | ✅ |
| **OPTIONAL** | `OPTIONAL_COOKIE_DOMAINS_BY_LABEL` | `youtube`, `docs`, `myaccount`, `mail` | ❌ (opt-in via `--include-domains=<label>[,…]` or `=all`) |

The REQUIRED tier is exactly the set traced through every exercised code path (API
host, identity carriers, authenticated media downloads, Drive-source ingest);
removing any one breaks an observed flow. **Data minimization** motivates the split:
`storage_state.json` is a high-value target, and the OPTIONAL tier carries cookies
that would let an attacker read Gmail / Drive / YouTube — none of which any
NotebookLM path needs. The control is enforced at **extraction time** (what
`rookiepy.load(domains=...)` is asked for), so excluded cookies are never written to
disk ([#483](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/483)). Opt in only when a
sibling flow needs it — e.g.
`notebooklm login --browser-cookies firefox --include-domains=youtube,docs`.

---

## 3 · Threat model

### 3.1 What kills a session in practice

In rough order of likelihood:

1. **`*PSIDTS` rotation drift.** Cookies on disk go stale because nothing rotates
   them. Any RPC after the grace period fails with a redirect to
   `accounts.google.com/v3/signin/…`. **The dominant failure mode for unattended
   use** — and the one the recovery ladder exists to defeat.
2. **Risk-scored revalidation.** Google flags the access pattern (new IP, no
   fingerprint, suspicious cadence, geography mismatch) and forces full re-auth.
   Less predictable; days-to-weeks into a long-running deployment.
3. **Password change or manual sign-out** anywhere — invalidates all sessions
   instantly.
4. **Workspace policy timeouts.** Some org admins enforce re-auth intervals; varies
   by tenant.
5. **DBSC enforcement (emerging).** See §2.3. Does not affect non-Chrome HTTP
   clients today; the long-term threat.

Cookie decay clocks by class:

| Cookie | Rotation / expiry signal | Lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| `__Secure-1PSIDTS` / `*-3PSIDTS` | Recommended cadence ~600 s (`["identity.hfcr",600]`); not a hard TTL | Refreshed opportunistically. An *un-superseded* stale value works for hours-to-days; a **superseded** one dies within ~30 min (§2.5) |
| `SIDCC` / `__Secure-*SIDCC` | ~5 min sliding window | Ephemeral; generally not load-bearing for auth |
| `SID`, `HSID`, `SSID`, `APISID`, `SAPISID` (+ `__Secure-` cousins) | Months → ~1 year | Long-lived identity; not rotated by us |
| `OSID`, `__Secure-OSID` | Per-product session | Re-issued on each sign-in |
| `LSID`, `__Host-*LSID`, `__Host-GAPS` | Long-lived | Identity-service / anti-takeover cookies |

### 3.2 Internal persistence hazards (pointer)

A separate failure class is easy to misattribute to Google: the library corrupting
its own cookie state during the read-merge-write cycle. Historically several such
hazards existed (a stale-in-memory-clobbers-fresh-disk race, `(name, domain)`
path-collapse, sibling-domain allow-list asymmetry, round-trip attribute erosion).
**All of them are resolved in-tree** — the persistence path is now snapshot/delta,
CAS-guarded, cross-process flocked, fully `(name, domain, path)`-aware, and funneled
through the path-owned cookie transactions in `_auth/profile_store.py`. The same
store now owns browser/remint, login/import, and minted-session replacement, while the pure raw
capture/domain filter and its value-free diagnostics live in `_auth/cookie_filter.py`; v0.x
signatures, results, and browser patch timing remain adapted by `_auth/storage.py`. Legacy account
policy and lifecycle now live in `_auth/profile_migration.py`: two-read resolution, typed
promotion, embed-before-scrub cleanup, canonical retryable single-flight scheduling, and
post-login/account-write reconciliation
([ADR-0029](adr/0029-canonical-storage-writer.md)). If users
report cookies "expiring fast", walk the
[diagnostic checklist](#a2--diagnosing-cookies-expire-fast) in the Appendix (which
also records the historical hazards and their fixes) before assuming Google changed
anything.

Cold stored-auth construction now preserves persistence provenance end to end. One raw sample in
`_auth/cookies.py` builds both the live jar and a typed baseline whose SameSite value comes from the
same successfully converted row. `_auth/refresh.py` selects the exact initial, refresh-command,
headless, or master-token replacement baseline; `_auth/recovery.py` carries paired replacement
results. Before returning file auth, `StoredAuthLoader` performs the initial `ProfileStore` merge:
accepted identities advance from authoritative final rows, rejected conflicts retain their old
baseline, and a hard merge failure retains the acquisition baseline for a later retry. The closed
file result carries its store and exact baseline. Phase 10 registers that exact pair with runtime
`CookiePersistence` without a second read. Direct file clients prepare one disk baseline before
transport; missing, malformed, or invalid input produces sticky failed typed state, while fileless
clients keep a one-shot live compatibility projection and no typed state.

`CookiePersistence` owns `Uninitialized`, `ReadyBaseline`, and `FailedBaseline` per canonical path
plus a concrete per-key legacy snapshot adapter. A missing saver always uses the private ordered
`ProfileStore` merge. Only an explicit `cookie_saver=` uses the public v0.x callback contract;
those overrides lazily initialize their own retryable adapter snapshot and do not write from invalid
input. Successful compatibility saves invalidate typed ready state for a fresh later read, but do
not clear sticky failure. `ClientLifecycle` selects the route before default-failure gates and alone
mirrors the loaded projection into the client-owned `AuthTokens.cookie_snapshot` after open and
accepted saves; first-party persistence retains no `AuthTokens`.

### 3.3 Empirical cookie requirements

Which cookies does Google *actually* require? This backs the library's two-tier
`_validate_required_cookies()` pre-flight (see `_auth/cookie_policy.py` —
`MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES` and `_has_valid_secondary_binding()` for the
authoritative values; the historical permissive `{"SID"}` check was replaced in
[#371](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/371)).

Method: take a known-good `storage_state.json`, drop one, two, or three cookies
at a time, run `notebooklm list`, and record whether Google accepts the call or
redirects to login. Single-cookie removal is highly recoverable — every cookie
except `SID` can be dropped individually with the call still succeeding (Google
reissues most of them mid-call). Pair-wise removal exposed the original
accept-rule; a follow-up three-way ablation of `OSID`, the `APISID`/`SAPISID`
pair, and bare `LSID` corrected its secondary-binding branch.

**The accept-rule model.** Google accepts the NotebookLM homepage GET when both
hold:

1. **Identity present:** `SID` is valid, and `__Secure-1PSIDTS` is either directly
   present or recoverable via a `RotateCookies` POST — which itself requires the
   full ambient cookie set to authenticate.
2. **At least one secondary binding present:** `OSID`, OR all three of
   `APISID`, `SAPISID`, and bare `LSID`.

The singleton and pair-wise ablations established Tier 1 and the two candidate
secondary-binding routes:

| Variant | `SID` | `OSID` | `APISID+SAPISID` | `__Secure-1PSIDTS` (or recoverable) | Result |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Baseline | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | OK |
| Drop `__Secure-1PSIDTS` only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | recoverable | OK |
| Drop `__Secure-1PSIDTS` + any one other | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | broken (mint POST fails) | FAIL |
| Drop `OSID` only | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | OK (AP\*SID path) |
| Drop `APISID + SAPISID` | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | OK (OSID path) |
| Drop `APISID + OSID` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | FAIL |
| Drop `SAPISID + OSID` | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | FAIL |

Holding `SID` and a live (or recoverable) `__Secure-1PSIDTS` constant, the
corrected three-way ablation is:

| `OSID` | `APISID` + `SAPISID` | bare `LSID` | Result |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| present | absent | absent | OK |
| present | present | absent | OK |
| absent | present | present | OK |
| absent | present | absent | **FAIL** |
| absent | absent | present | FAIL |

The first row confirms that `OSID` alone is sufficient, even when every
`accounts.google.com` cookie (including `LSID`) is absent. `LSID` is required
only for the `APISID`/`SAPISID` branch. The fourth row retains
`__Host-1PLSID` and `__Host-3PLSID`, so neither host-prefixed cookie substitutes
for bare `LSID`.

Before #371 the library trusted any storage with `SID` present, which let
Google-rejected cookie sets reach the wire — the "auth expires immediately after
`notebooklm login`" pattern
([#133](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/133),
[#332](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/332)). The pre-flight now
catches it with a two-tier check:

```python
MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES = {"SID", "__Secure-1PSIDTS"}  # Tier 1: raise


def _has_valid_secondary_binding(cookie_names: set[str]) -> bool:  # Tier 2: warn
    if "OSID" in cookie_names:
        return True
    return {"APISID", "SAPISID", "LSID"} <= cookie_names


def _has_rotatable_secondary_binding(cookie_names: set[str]) -> bool:  # recovery only
    if "OSID" in cookie_names:
        return True
    return {"APISID", "SAPISID"} <= cookie_names
```

Tier 1 raises on unambiguous evidence; Tier 2 warns once per process so partial
extractions surface without breaking edge-case flows (e.g. Workspace SSO) that
haven't been ablated.

**Caveats.** The singleton and pair-wise observations came from a single
non-Workspace, stable-IP profile, testing `notebooks.list`. The corrected
three-way secondary-binding ablation was replicated on two unrelated accounts
(2026-08-04, issue #1977). Workspace accounts may have different accept-rules.
This is a model fit, not a confirmed server mechanism, and the freshness clock
(§3.1) still applies on top of it — a session with a valid accept-tuple can still
be killed by Google's risk model.

---

## 4 · The recovery ladder

The library escalates progressively as cheaper mechanisms fail (see the ladder
table in the [TL;DR](#tldr)). Each layer is a fallback for the one below it: L1/L2
are HTTP-only and cheap; L3 drives a browser and only helps if the profile's Google
session is still alive; **L4 re-mints from a durable master token with no browser —
the best unattended recovery**; L5 delegates policy to the operator, and — opt-in —
can now fire mid-session as well as at cold start (§4.5); L6 is manual; L7 is
proactive scheduling for idle profiles.

Cold-start L3/L4 recovery and the L5 refresh-cmd both coalesce duplicate work
through one process-global core, `_auth/single_flight.py`
([ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)): a leader on one event loop drives
the attempt as an `asyncio.Task`, followers on *any* loop in the process bridge to
its result, and a per-canonical-path success epoch lets a late waiter skip a
redundant attempt entirely once a sibling has already succeeded. This replaced two
independently hand-rolled same-loop-only coalescing implementations that had
drifted apart between `refresh.py` and `recovery.py`. It is a formalisation of the
existing cross-loop pattern, not a change to the mid-session
`AuthRefreshCoordinator`, which ADR-0030 deliberately leaves untouched (ADR-0004
loop-affinity still governs the client itself: coalescing the *recovery attempt*
across loops does not make a `NotebookLMClient` shareable across loops).

Cold-token fallback composition now has one operation-scoped owner:
`_auth/recovery.py::ColdRecoveryCoordinator` explicitly runs L2.5, then the coalesced L3 → L4
flow. `_auth/refresh.py` remains its sole production composer and retains the exact environment-auth
skip, rung-start/failure logs, call-time collaborator lookup, and raw caller / canonical L2.5 / raw
caller route timing. `ColdRecoveryState` owns synchronized weak-loop path locks and success
generations; `SingleFlight` owns shared flights. The compatibility `_run_cold_recovery` and
`coalesced_cold_recovery` functions delegate to the class-owned bodies rather than retaining a
second ladder. A coordinator is one-shot, claims before its first await, and scrubs every injected
callback after success, failure, or cancellation. Cancellation before synchronous caller-jar
replacement leaves that jar untouched; cancellation later does not roll back a completed
replacement. A cancelled follower waits for shared settlement without cancelling siblings.

### 4.1 L1 — per-call `RotateCookies` POST

Fires inside the token-fetch path on every CLI invocation and client open. A best-
effort `POST https://accounts.google.com/RotateCookies` that mints a fresh
`*PSIDTS`. Default ON; disable with `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1`. Wrapped
in three concentric guards (disk-mtime fast-path → `RotationState`'s per-loop
`asyncio.Lock` + per-canonical-path monotonic timestamp → cross-process non-blocking flock) so an L1 caller,
an L2 loop, and a fan-out of parallel CLI invocations keyed to the same
`storage_state.json` don't stampede the endpoint into a 429. Mechanics in
[§5](#5--the-rotatecookies-primitive). The atomic attempt claim is stamped before
the POST; HTTP failure and cancellation therefore consume the same 60-second slot as success.

### 4.2 L2 — background keepalive task

`NotebookLMClient(keepalive=N)` starts an `asyncio.Task` that pokes
`RotateCookies` every N seconds (floor 60 s) while the client is open. Self-paced,
so it bypasses the L1 fast-path guards but still performs the atomic per-profile
claim, so a sibling L1 poke sees the in-flight rotation and skips. Covers agents,
MCP servers, and long-running workers. The built-in MCP and REST adapters pass
`keepalive=600` by default; general SDK clients retain the explicit opt-in.

After a confirmed mid-session rejection, a file-backed client also re-reads its
persisted cookie jar before invoking L2.5/L3/L4. This local retry performs no
network I/O or write and only replaces an unchanged live jar when the selected
profile generation differs. Cookies and the in-band `authuser`/account email are
sampled once and installed coherently under the auth snapshot lock; the homepage
URL is rebuilt from that route for each retry, including account-only rewrites
and resets to the default account. Its exact disk sample becomes the persistence
baseline for the retry's response cookies only while disk still matches; a newer sibling
generation remains CAS-protected. Ambient redirect-cookie churn cannot starve
the disk sample, while a newer in-memory SID/PSIDTS or secondary-binding
candidate is tried before a lagging disk snapshot; one final disk attempt keeps
the sequence bounded. Cold-start clients already load that same file, so the
bridge is mid-session-only and does not add another numbered credential tier. A
REST process that could not bind its client because startup auth was stale
retries that bind on its next client-dependent request. After that immediate
retry, repeated failures are negative-cached for five seconds so
steady request traffic cannot launch an unbounded sequence of full bootstraps.

### 4.3 L3 — headless re-auth / CDP attach

When the homepage GET 302s to the Google login page, the first-party cookies are
fully dead and neither L1 nor L2 can help. `from_storage(allow_headless=True)`,
`refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)`, `auth refresh --allow-headless`, or
`NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1` drives an unattended
headless browser against the **persisted profile that is a sibling of this client's
storage file** — `browser_profile/` beside a conventional `storage_state.json`,
or `<storage_path>.browser_profile/` for a normal-length custom filename; names
that would exceed the filesystem component limit use a stable hash of the
canonical storage path — never the ambient profile. This lets two custom storage
files in the same directory retain separate Google sessions. The ownership marker
written during path preparation is ignored when deciding whether the directory
contains reusable Chrome state. L3 silently re-mints cookies, reloads them, and
retries the homepage GET once. Set
`NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9222` to attach
to an already-running local Chrome instead; non-loopback hosts are refused because
a CDP endpoint is account-equivalent. If the profile is missing, Playwright is
unavailable, env-var auth has no writeable file, or the browser session is also
dead, the original auth-expiry error stands. Owner:
`_auth/headless_reauth.py`; shared cold/mid-session adapters and cold
single-flight coordination live in `_auth/recovery.py`.

### 4.4 L4 — master-token re-mint

When the profile holds a `master_token.json` (written by
`notebooklm login --master-token`, the `[headless]` extra), a fully-expired session
re-mints **in process, with no browser** — the recovery the `RotateCookies` /
headless-browser ladder can't provide off-device.

- **Credential.** A durable Google **master token** (`aas_et/…`), obtained once from
  `accounts.google.com/EmbeddedSetup` and stored `0600`. It mints fresh web cookies
  on demand (`perform_oauth → OAuthLogin?issueuberauth=1 → MergeSession`) and
  survives password changes until explicitly revoked. It also bootstraps the initial
  `storage_state.json`.
- **Where it fires.** `_auth/recovery.py::try_master_token_reauth`, as layer 4
  after L1 (homepage), L2 (`RotateCookies`), and L3 (headless browser) are
  exhausted. Both cold token loading and mid-session `refresh_auth_session`
  delegate to this adapter. It mints a new session, persists it through the
  compatibility writers in `_auth/storage.py`, which route transaction/commit mechanics through
  `_auth/profile_store.py` and `_auth/credential_io.py` (§A2, [ADR-0029](adr/0029-canonical-storage-writer.md)),
  reloads the jar, and retries the homepage GET once. Cold-start callers on
  **any** event loop — not just the same one — now coalesce onto one recovery
  attempt via the `single_flight` core; `recovery.py` layers its own per-loop
  revalidate-on-bump epoch on top so a fresh loop still runs the full ladder
  rather than trusting a stale cross-loop success blindly. Live-client
  mid-session RPCs retain their separate, untouched `AuthRefreshCoordinator`
  single-flight.
- **Cold start.** The normal file-backed token loader invokes the same L4 adapter
  after a confirmed login redirect, so a session already dead at process start
  recovers without a forced pre-mint.
- **PSIDTS interaction.** A re-mint yields `SID`+`APISID`+`SAPISID` but not
  `__Secure-1PSIDTS`; the mint itself fires one best-effort `RotateCookies` POST to
  add it, and the inline PSIDTS recovery
  ([§5.4](#54-inline-__secure-1psidts-cold-start-recovery)) mints it from the
  secondary binding on reload if Google withheld it — so L1 keepalive then proceeds
  normally on the fresh session.
- **Security & limits.** The master token is full-account and infostealer-grade —
  dedicated/throwaway account only, never logged or committed. Each re-mint is a new
  session, so one account is **single-consumer**: concurrent re-mints can invalidate
  each other's `SID`. DBSC is the standing risk; re-mint is itself the mitigation
  while it isn't enforced. See [ADR-0023](adr/0023-master-token-headless-auth.md).

### 4.5 L5–L7

- **L5 — `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`.** An operator-supplied recovery command run on
  an auth-expiry signal, with one retry. Fires at cold start by default; set
  `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_MIDSESSION=1` to opt into firing mid-session too
  (rung "L2.5" in the code's internal escalation order — [ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)).
  Callers on any loop coalesce on one subprocess (cancellation-safe) via
  `single_flight`, and a per-canonical-path flock now also serializes the
  subprocess **across processes**, closing the earlier stampede where N
  processes each spawned their own recovery command. See
  [§6.2](#62-notebooklm_refresh_cmdcommand-line-l5).
- **L6 — `notebooklm login`.** Baseline manual recovery: interactive browser
  sign-in, or `--browser-cookies <browser>` extraction (§2.4).
- **L7 — `notebooklm auth refresh`.** A one-shot token fetch driven by cron /
  launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler / k8s CronJob, for profiles idle between Python
  runs. Recommended cadence 15–20 min.

## 5 · The `RotateCookies` primitive

The L1/L2 rotation POST and the L4 re-mint's PSIDTS top-up all share one endpoint.

### 5.1 The endpoint

```
POST https://accounts.google.com/RotateCookies
Content-Type: application/json
Origin: https://accounts.google.com

[000,"-0000000000000000000"]
```

The body is a JSPB (array-shaped) sentinel. `000` is `0` written with leading zeros
(valid in Google's JSPB parser, invalid in strict JSON); `"-0000000000000000000"`
is a sentinel meaning "I have no prior `__Secure-1PSIDTS`, mint a fresh one from the
persistent identity (`SID`/`PSID`) alone." The pattern is borrowed from
[`HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API`](https://github.com/HanaokaYuzu/Gemini-API/blob/master/src/gemini_webapi/utils/rotate_1psidts.py),
which has run it in production at scale.

### 5.2 The successful response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Set-Cookie: __Secure-1PSIDTS=<new>; Domain=.google.com; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: __Secure-3PSIDTS=<new>; Domain=.google.com; Secure; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: SIDCC=<new>; Domain=.google.com; Secure
…

)]}'  [["identity.hfcr",600],["di",<integer>]]
```

`)]}'` is Google's anti-XSSI prefix. `["identity.hfcr",600]` declares the
recommended next-rotation interval (600 s); `["di",N]` is an opaque session counter.
`_auth/storage.py::save_cookies_to_storage` captures the rotated `Set-Cookie`
headers and persists them atomically.

Why `RotateCookies` and not the older `CheckCookie` GET: `RotateCookies` rotates
`*PSIDTS` unconditionally for **both** browser-bound (Playwright) and unbound
(Firefox-extracted) sessions, whereas `CheckCookie` only rotated for unbound ones.
Historical detail in the [Appendix](#a1--rotatecookies-vs-checkcookie).

### 5.3 Rate limiting and the three-guard throttle

Hammering `RotateCookies` triggers HTTP 429. The mitigation is a 60-second floor,
enforced by three concentric guards (`_auth/keepalive.py`,
[#346](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/346) +
[#348](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/348)):

1. **Disk-mtime fast-path** — skip without any lock if `storage_state.json` was
   rewritten within `_KEEPALIVE_RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS` (60 s). A 2 s tolerance absorbs
   filesystem mtime granularity; a far-future mtime is treated as not-recent.
2. **In-process throttle** — inside an `asyncio.Lock` keyed by
   `(running loop, storage_path)`, re-check mtime plus a per-profile monotonic
   timestamp stamped under a `threading.Lock`. Deduplicates an `asyncio.gather`
   fan-out; the timestamp is bumped *before* the network await so a hung
   `accounts.google.com` doesn't make N callers each wait the full timeout.
3. **Cross-process non-blocking flock** (`.storage_state.json.rotate.lock` via
   `LOCK_NB`) — if another process holds it, skip; they're rotating now. Distinct
   from the save-path lock so a long save never blocks rotations. Locks **fail
   open** on read-only / NFS filesystems: rotation proceeds rather than wedging.

Together the three guards cover sequential CLI invocations (mtime fast-path), an
`asyncio.gather` fan-out from one process (in-process lock + stamp), an L1 caller
racing the L2 loop (per-profile monotonic stamp), and simultaneous processes
(cross-process flock). The per-`(loop, profile)` lock dict is a `WeakKeyDictionary`
keyed on the loop object, so a short-lived `asyncio.run()` loop's inner dict is
reclaimed on GC. All three guards, plus the refresh-cmd flock in
[§6.2](#62-notebooklm_refresh_cmdcommand-line-l5), key on
`canonical_storage_key(storage_path)` (`_auth/paths.py`) rather than the raw path,
so two spellings of one profile (relative vs. absolute, symlinked, `~`-expanded)
collapse onto a single throttle slot instead of each getting its own budget.

### 5.4 Inline `__Secure-1PSIDTS` cold-start recovery

When a profile has the persistent `__Secure-1PSID` but no transient
`__Secure-1PSIDTS` (a common cold-start snapshot), `_recover_psidts_inline`
(`_auth/psidts_recovery.py`) makes a preflight `RotateCookies` POST during client
startup to mint the missing cookie before the first RPC.

**This recovery runs off the event loop for async callers ([ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)).**
`cookies.py` owns the pure cookie loaders (file I/O + validation, never network), while
`psidts_recovery.load_with_recovery` receives the selected pure loader explicitly and owns the
single strict-load → heal → name-only-retry sequence. Public wrappers
(`build_httpx_cookies_from_storage`, `load_auth_from_storage`) preserve their signatures and late
lookup seams. The pure loader raises
`RequiredCookieValidationError` tagged with a closed-enum `reason`
(`missing_cookie` | `psidts_unroutable`) instead of invoking recovery itself; the
wrapper decides whether to call `_recover_psidts_inline` based on that reason.
Sync (CLI) callers keep the inline recovery behavior verbatim; async callers
offload the whole wrapper onto `asyncio.to_thread`, so the ~15 s `RotateCookies`
POST below cannot stall an async caller's event loop. The wrapper catches only the required-cookie
validation that triggers a heal; Unicode failures, cancellation, and unlisted exceptions retain
their original identity instead of being collapsed into a recovery decline.

It fires only when `SID`
is present, a **rotatable** secondary binding is intact (`OSID`, or `APISID` +
`SAPISID`), and no live `__Secure-1PSIDTS` would be **sent to**
`accounts.google.com` — that is, the cookie is absent, expired, or scoped to a
domain that does not route to the
rotate URL. That last condition is RFC 6265 selection against the URL the
decision is about, not a domain-priority ranking: a `__Secure-1PSIDTS` scoped to
`.notebooklm.google.com` (or, post-rebrand, `.notebook.google.com`) never reaches
`accounts.google.com`, while a host-scoped one on `accounts.google.com` does
(issue #2057).

**The gate is only reachable because the cookie-load preflight asks the same
question.** Recovery is invoked from the `except` arm around the loaders'
required-cookie validation, so whatever that validation accepts, recovery never
sees. Validating cookie *names* alone made a present-but-unusable
`__Secure-1PSIDTS` — expired, or scoped so it never routes to
`accounts.google.com` — satisfy the preflight and skip recovery entirely, which
left the expiry arm of the gate above largely unreachable through the built-in
callers. The loaders now run `_validate_routable_entries`: required names, then
the same RFC 6265 routing predicate the gate uses. The two conditions are
written against one function so they cannot drift apart silently (issue #2061).

**The routing preflight belongs only where a heal follows it, and it is never
stricter than that heal.** The condition asks whether `__Secure-1PSIDTS` would
be *sent to the rotate URL* — a question about whether the cookie can be
**refreshed**, not whether it can be **used**. One scoped to the app host is
delivered on every app request while never reaching `accounts.google.com`:
unrotatable, but not unusable. So:

- Loaders with a recovery arm (`build_httpx_cookies_from_storage`,
  `load_auth_from_storage`) raise it — and when recovery *declines* (inline
  `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` has no writable store, no rotatable secondary binding,
  a contended lock, a throttled slot) they retry name-only rather than harden
  into a failure nothing can repair.
- Loaders without one stay name-only: `load_httpx_cookies` (artifact downloads)
  and `_build_httpx_cookies_from_storage_strict` (the `fetch_tokens_passive`
  probe, which exists precisely so no heal fires).

The net effect is a heal *attempt* in states that previously went straight to a
failing RPC, and no new terminal failures: every state that loaded before still
loads.

This is deliberately the weaker `_has_rotatable_secondary_binding()` recovery
precondition: unlike the strict post-recovery predicate in §3.3, it does not
require bare `LSID`, because the rotation hop may restore that accounts-side
cookie. See `_auth/cookie_policy.py` for why
`_has_rotatable_secondary_binding` and `_has_valid_secondary_binding` must
remain distinct.

The separate "did the heal land?" check (`_psidts_is_live`) is deliberately
domain-blind instead, because it must predict the retrying preflight rather than
the request jar. **Do not merge `_psidts_routes_to_rotate` and
`_psidts_is_live`.** Their differences are
intentional, and each one has a failure mode behind it:

| | should we fire? (`_psidts_routes_to_rotate`) | did it land? (`_psidts_is_live`) |
|---|---|---|
| domain | RFC 6265 routing to the rotate URL | blind — matches the preflight |
| duplicate `(name, domain, path)` | any expired twin disqualifies the identity, mirroring the jar's one-cookie-per-identity replacement | ignored |
| malformed `expires` | row cannot be sent, so it does not count → fire | row is on disk and the preflight will see it → counts as present |
| known-expired row | does not route | does not count (issue #1273) |
| empty `value` | skipped | skipped |

The duplicate rule is the sharp edge. Applying it to the heal check turns a
working session into a permanent failure loop: the typed cookie merge
CAS-matches the observed value for an identity, so a stale same-identity
twin survives the save, and the heal would report failure on every load while
the preflight keeps passing. That twin is issue #1523's data shape — #1523 fixed
the producer, and nothing on the load/save path removed an existing one.

**One heal check is routed, and only one.** There are two "did it land?"
questions, asked by different processes:

- The process that *made* the POST re-reads disk through `_psidts_save_succeeded`
  → `_is_psidts_persisted` → the domain-blind `_psidts_is_live`. Unchanged, for
  the reason above.
- A process that found the flock **held** asks whether the holder's heal makes
  *its own* load succeed, so it must ask the routed question
  (`_is_psidts_routed_on_disk`). A domain-blind answer there reports "healed",
  the caller retries, and the routed preflight rejects the state anyway.

The routed variant is safe only because the save collapses the twin instead of
leaving it: when `ProfileStore.merge_cookie_observation` receives a typed
`RecoveryObservation`, an
observed recovery-target identity is replaced in place and its exact duplicates
are removed, across leading-dot domain variants. A row the observation saw as
unusable — empty, non-string, or malformed `expires` — is replaceable; a
non-empty value that was *not* observed before the POST is still a CAS conflict
and is left alone. Without that collapse the routed check would reproduce the
permanent failure loop described above, which is why the two changes have to
travel together.

Note also that `_psidts_is_live` models the domain-blind persisted answer, while routed preflight
models what the RotateCookies request can send; neither substitutes for a pure loader. Recovery
reads raw rows through `ProfileStore.read_document()`/`ProfileDocument`, captures a value-only
observation before the POST, converts live jars through `CookieJar`, and commits through
`ProfileStore` without rejoining `cookies.py` or the `storage.py` compatibility facade. A save
result alone is never success: a post-save disk reread is authoritative and may accept a sibling
winner.

Recovery honors
`NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1`, and uses a cross-process flock
(`psidts_recovery.lock`) so concurrent cold-start processes don't fan out identical
recovery calls. This is what lets the L4 re-mint (which produces `SID` +
`APISID`/`SAPISID` but not `*PSIDTS`) heal into a complete jar on reload. See
[ADR-0013](adr/0013-composable-session-capabilities.md#consequences).

## 6 · Operational levers (environment variables)

Auth-refresh env vars live under `src/notebooklm/_auth/` and are re-exported through
the public `notebooklm.auth` facade where compatibility requires it. See also
[configuration.md#environment-variables](configuration.md#environment-variables).

### 6.1 `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE=1`

Disables the `RotateCookies` POST entirely. Both L1 and L2 honor it (the L2 task
still wakes on its interval — only the network call becomes a no-op; pass
`keepalive=None` to stop the loop itself). Set it on restricted networks that block
outbound POSTs to `accounts.google.com`, for regression triage, or in test
environments that mock the auth surface.

### 6.2 `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD=<command-line>` (L5)

Reactive recovery hook (merged in
[#336](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/336), hardened to
`shell=False` by default in
[#475](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/475); owner
`_auth/refresh.py`). When token fetch fails with an auth-expiry signal (the
"`Authentication expired or invalid`" / `accounts.google.com` redirect), the
library:

1. Parses the command with `shlex.split` (POSIX) / `CommandLineToArgvW` (Windows)
   and runs it via `subprocess.run(argv, shell=False, …)` with a 60 s timeout. Set
   `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_USE_SHELL=1` to opt back into `shell=True` (a `WARNING`
   is logged each invocation).
2. Sets `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_PROFILE` / `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH` in the
   child env so the script knows which profile to refresh.
3. Sets `_NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_ATTEMPTED=1` to prevent recursive refresh loops.
4. Scrubs credential/secret env vars from the child env — `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`,
   `NOTEBOOKLM_SERVER_TOKEN`, `NOTEBOOKLM_SERVER_TOKEN_FILE`,
   `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_TOKEN`, `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_PASSWORD`,
   `NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_OAUTH_STATE_PATH` — so a long-lived server's own secrets can't
   leak into every refresh subprocess and its grandchildren; the script gets the
   on-disk storage path via step 2 instead. Widened from the single
   `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` scrub once this rung became reachable mid-session
   ([ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)).
5. Reloads cookies from `storage_state.json` and replays the token fetch once.

> **SECURITY — inherited environment.** The refresh command inherits the **full
> parent environment** (minus the scrubbed vars above) so it can find
> `PATH`/`HOME`/proxy settings and re-invoke this library. There is deliberately no
> allowlist. Any other secret in the launching shell is inherited by the command and
> every grandchild, and is visible via `/proc/<pid>/environ` to the same UID.
> Operators MUST NOT keep unrelated secrets in the launching environment
> ([#1274](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/1274)).

**Mid-session firing (opt-in, [ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)).** By
default the command only fires at cold start — client construction /
`AuthTokens.from_storage`. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_MIDSESSION=1` to also fire
it **mid-session**, e.g. inside a long-lived server whose cookies expired after the
client was already constructed. This is opt-in for one release — de-risking
operators whose command assumes cold-start-only invocation — and is expected to
flip to default-on in a later release. Passive readiness probes (`auth check --test
--passive`) never invoke it regardless of this flag: they use the strict,
no-recovery loader. Set `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_LOG_OUTPUT=1` to route the
command's captured stdout/stderr into the DEBUG logger; the default DEBUG line
records only the command basename, exit code, and byte counts, so promoting this
rung into a long-lived server doesn't widen exposure of whatever the command
prints.

Callers coalesce on one shielded in-flight subprocess via the cross-loop
`single_flight` core ([ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md)), so cancellation
of one caller doesn't cancel the shared command — this now holds **across event
loops in one process**, not just within one loop. A per-canonical-path flock
(mirroring the keepalive rotation lock, [§5.3](#53-rate-limiting-and-the-three-guard-throttle))
additionally serializes the subprocess **across processes**. This coalescing is
about the refresh-cmd subprocess only; cross-loop `NotebookLMClient` reuse is still
unsupported per [ADR-0004](adr/0004-loop-affinity-contract.md).

This is **orthogonal to L1–L4**: those proactively keep the session fresh (L1/L2) or
re-mint it in-process (L3/L4), while `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` runs only after auth
has already fully expired — useful for password-change / manual-sign-out recovery or
a custom CookieCloud / browser-cookie re-extract flow. Common shapes:

```bash
export NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD='notebooklm login --browser-cookies firefox'
export NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD='/opt/scripts/pull-cookies-from-cloud.sh'
```

The library does not validate the command's output; the operator must ensure it
produces a valid `storage_state.json`.

For the active `fetch_tokens_with_domains` path, cookie acquisition and persistence now share one
typed provenance chain. One raw load produces both the live jar and its SameSite-preserving
baseline. The initial route uses the caller-spelled raw path, the L2.5 retry uses its canonical
refresh path, and L3/L4 validation plus final fetch return to the caller-spelled raw path under the
Phase 12C `ColdRecoveryCoordinator`. Whichever successful arm wins supplies the selected baseline.
After token success, file auth snapshots the final live jar into an immutable observation and
offloads exactly one concrete `ProfileStore` merge. `HARD_FAILURE`, the sole non-advancing result,
keeps the exact selected baseline; an advancing result selects the exact returned next baseline.
Ordinary `asyncio.to_thread`
cancellation reaches the caller immediately, while an already-dispatched merge may still finish
and commit. Inline env auth performs no store work. Only the private
`refresh.save_cookies_to_storage` alias was retired; the public saver, storage/auth facades,
permanent no-baseline overlay, and client/runtime saver-injection seams remain compatible.

The v0.x `AuthTokens` value and signatures also remain compatible, but two storage-owning entry
points now have an explicit v1 runway. Awaiting `AuthTokens.from_storage(...)` and constructing
`AuthTokens(..., storage_path=..., cookie_jar=None)` emit `DeprecationWarning` from the user's call
site. The recommended owner is `async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...) as client:` with
`client.auth` used only inside that managed lifecycle. Suppress temporarily with
`NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS=1`; both compatibility paths are scheduled for removal in v1.0.

Cookie compatibility views have a parallel v0.9 runway. Direct
`AuthTokens.flat_cookies` access emits exactly one caller-attributed warning;
the warning-free `AuthTokens.jar` projection is the migration shape for the v1
`initial_cookies: CookieJar` bootstrap field. `cookies` and `cookie_jar` are
docs-only deprecated because synthesized dataclass operations read fields.
`cookie_header` and `cookie_header_for(url)` are also scheduled for v1 deletion
in favor of managed-client request APIs, but remain warning-free through v0.x.
The private flat projection used by `cookie_header` prevents an indirect
`flat_cookies` warning with a library-internal attribution.

This runway changes no routing semantics: `CookieJar` is an immutable, ordered
sequence, never a Mapping and never the live jar. It preserves full-fidelity
rows when constructed from authoritative row data; `CookieJar.from_httpx()` is
SameSite-lossy and is only a transient live observation. The kernel-owned
`httpx.Cookies` remains the sole mutable request/persistence authority after
bootstrap.

### 6.3 `NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1` and `NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL` (L3)

Opt into automatic L3 headless re-auth during mid-RPC refresh (explicit
`await client.refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)` needs no env var). The CDP URL, if
set, attaches to an already-running loopback Chrome instead of launching the stored
profile; non-loopback hosts are refused. Details in [§4.3](#43-l3--headless-re-auth--cdp-attach).

## 7 · Canaries and signals

Tripwires that would signal the threat model shifting:

| Signal | What it means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `RotateCookies` returns 401 in production | DBSC extended to non-Chrome paths for some accounts | Harden the L3 CDP arm; steer users to `NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL` or an L5 CookieCloud flow |
| `RotateCookies` returns 200 but no `*PSIDTS` in `Set-Cookie` | Silent failure — cookies on disk aren't rotating | WARN + alert; manual re-auth required |
| Gemini-API's bare-sentinel rotation reported decaying under DBSC | Upstream canary for the shared primitive | Assess whether our user base is affected; plan a mitigation |
| Chrome macOS DBSC GA announced | macOS users start getting DBSC enrollment | Several months' warning before consumer accounts may be enforced |
| Workspace session-binding leaves beta | More org admins will enable it | Document explicit non-support more clearly |

## Appendix: field notes & historical findings

Condensed war-stories and ruled-out experiments, kept for triage context. None of
this is required to operate the library.

### A1 · `RotateCookies` vs `CheckCookie`

The original L1 mechanism used
`GET accounts.google.com/CheckCookie?continue=…notebooklm.google.com/`, relying on
a redirect chain that *might* pass through `accounts.youtube.com/SetSID` and set a
fresh `*PSIDTS`. Field probing showed this rotates `*PSIDTS` only for
Firefox-extracted (unbound) profiles — a 3-hop chain including `SetSID` — and **not**
for Playwright-extracted (bound) profiles, whose 2-hop chain has no `SetSID` step
and no `*PSIDTS` in any `Set-Cookie`. The bound-session poke still touched the
identity surface and observably extended server-side session validity, but did not
rotate the cookie. A direct `RotateCookies` POST removes the discretion: it rotates
unconditionally for both session types, at a ~100% success rate in all field
captures, with no DBSC challenge on the unsigned endpoint.

### A2 · Diagnosing "cookies expire fast"

The persistence pipeline could historically corrupt its own cookie state. Before
assuming Google changed anything:

1. **Compare `__Secure-1PSIDTS` on disk before/after a `notebooklm` call** spaced
   > 60 s apart with no other writer. No change ⇒ rotation isn't firing — check
   `NOTEBOOKLM_DISABLE_KEEPALIVE_POKE` and the mtime guard.
2. **With multiple processes sharing the file**, run at `NOTEBOOKLM_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
   and look for "Keepalive RotateCookies skipped: storage refreshed before flock
   acquired" — that means the guards are working.
3. **Check `storage_state.json` mtime cadence** — hours-old mtime after active
   sessions means rotation isn't sticking.
4. **Only after the above**, investigate Google-side causes (risk-scoring, Workspace
   policy, DBSC).

**Historical persistence hazards (all resolved in-tree)** — recorded so older bug
reports still make sense:

- **Stale-in-memory clobbers fresh-disk ("few-hours" pattern).** A `keepalive=None`
  process could write its stale in-memory `*PSIDTS` over a fresher value a sibling
  rotated. Resolved by open-time snapshot + write-only-deltas with value-CAS guards
  (`_cookie_persistence.py`), on top of the cross-process flock
  ([#344](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/344) +
  [#361](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/361)). Still, prefer
  `keepalive=N` or a single cron-driven rotator.
- **`(name, domain)` path-collapse.** The persistence merge is now fully
  `(name, domain, path)`-aware end-to-end, so path-scoped variants survive a
  load→save round-trip ([#369](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/369)).
- **Sibling-domain allow-list asymmetry.** The auth-jar and persistence filters were
  collapsed into one canonical `_is_allowed_cookie_domain` with siblings covered
  symmetrically ([#360](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/360)).
- **Round-trip attribute erosion.** Both load paths now build a faithful
  `http.cookiejar.Cookie` preserving `path` / `secure` / `httpOnly` across cycles
  ([#365](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/365)), keeping `__Host-`
  invariants intact.
- **`expires=-1` flattens age.** `*PSIDTS` rotations arrive without `Max-Age` and are
  stored as session cookies, so on-disk age is unknowable — the only staleness signal
  is the file mtime. By design, not a bug.
- **Divergent writers, divergent locks (write consolidation).** Cookie saves,
  in-band account-metadata writes, and master-token persistence each hand-rolled
  their own write path: cookie saves used the project's own `flock` primitive,
  `_auth/account.py` and `_auth/master_token.py` used `filelock.FileLock` with a
  10 s timeout, and `write_master_token` had no lock at all. Resolved by
  [ADR-0029](adr/0029-canonical-storage-writer.md), then sealed by ADR-0034:
  `_auth/credential_io.py` alone holds the unchecked atomic capability,
  `_auth/profile_store.py` owns cookie transactions, typed in-band account
  read/update/clear, and browser/remint, login/import, and minted-session replacement.
  Login filters and validates required names before any destination access, applies
  directive-specific namespace rules, optionally backs up under the same lock, then commits once.
  `_auth/cookie_filter.py` owns that raw filter and its value-free diagnostics.
  `_auth/profile_migration.py` owns legacy two-read account resolution, typed sanitization,
  only-if-absent embed-before-scrub promotion, sibling `context.json.lock` cleanup, the canonical
  retryable per-path single-flight scheduler, and post-login/account-write reconciliation. An
  already in-band account with a stale legacy copy schedules the scrub, closing the crash gap
  between those two writes. Per-RPC reads do not wait for promotion; the exit hook drains workers
  within one
  shared budget (30 seconds by default, configurable) and warns if any
  outlives it.
  `_auth/storage.py` retains the remint and raw-signature compatibility seams, the minted
  snapshot/error adapter, and token policies. Minted input is frozen before path/lock work: the live jar is copied with the raw
  master-token serializer fields (including `same_site="None"`, not the filtering/SameSite-lossy
  `CookieJar.from_httpx()` path), and the permissive email is deep-copied with the same memo.
  The store then performs the latest-owner gate, default filter, destination rebind, and one commit
  under one lock. The adapter translates a private refusal outside its handler to context-free
  canonical `MasterTokenError`. This jar-and-email snapshot timing is the deliberate isolation
  correction. `LoginProfileWriter` allows only an applied login result to reach legacy
  promote-or-scrub, after lock release; `AccountMetadataWriter` retains update/clear-specific
  post-operation ordering.
  Empty account placeholders no longer block legacy promotion;
  non-empty unknown-only records still win. Function-granular AST guardrails
  (`tests/_guardrails/test_storage_writer_boundary.py`) seal the capability and caller sets.
  The full-replace paths share one platform-neutral bounded lock (90 s deadline, up from 10 s).
  Those writers (account metadata, master-token persist) now **fail closed**, raising
  `LockUnavailableError` rather than silently skipping the write, while the CAS
  cookie merge keeps its status-quo **fail-open** behavior (availability is safe
  there; the CAS guard itself prevents a lost update). A shared dispatch-order guard
  across public legacy and private canonical saves additionally makes a stale queued save drop
  itself
  instead of overwriting a save that already landed.

Across the OSS ecosystem this is the most defensive cookie-persistence implementation
surveyed: peers (Gemini-API, yt-dlp, CookieCloud) are "last writer wins" with no
flock, no atomic replace, and full-jar overwrite. Our threat model (long-lived
clients + cron `auth refresh` + parallel CLI invocations on one file) genuinely needs
the snapshot/delta/CAS/flock defenses.

### A3 · Ruled-out experiments

Investigated and rejected; documented so contributors don't re-investigate:

- **`undetected-chromedriver` / `selenium-stealth` for Google login** — WebDriver
  stealth loses to Google's signal-fusion model; login has been repeatedly broken
  across Chrome bumps. Don't use for Google flows.
- **`puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` / `playwright-stealth`** — patches fingerprint
  leaks only, not TLS / IP reputation / behavioral signals; works for resumed
  sessions, fails for fresh `accounts.google.com` sign-in.
- **Persistent Playwright headless context as a keepalive daemon** — fragile against
  known Playwright bugs (cookies missing in `launch_persistent_context`, profile-DB
  corruption in long-lived contexts). Prefer CDP-attach (the L3 arm) if a
  headless-browser path is needed.
- **Client-side DBSC implementation** — impossible from Python: the W3C spec is
  built around a TPM-bound key and platform attestation Chrome implements, with no
  extension point for a non-browser client. If DBSC extends to non-Chrome paths, the
  escape is to parasitize a DBSC-enrolled Chrome via the L3 CDP arm, or source
  cookies via an operator-provided `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`.
- **Reading the Chrome cookie DB on Chrome 127+** — App-Bound Encryption makes this
  admin-or-bust on Windows; the yt-dlp ecosystem has converged on Firefox as the
  only reliable `--cookies-from-browser` source. Infostealer-adjacent ABE-bypass
  forks are inappropriate to ship. Document `--browser-cookies firefox` as the
  Windows path.

### A4 · Anti-pattern — persisting `storage_state` on a redirect-to-login

If you write your own Playwright keepalive instead of using `notebooklm auth
refresh` or `keepalive=N`, the most damaging mistake is calling
`context.storage_state(path=…)` unconditionally at the end of each cycle. When the
session has aged out, `page.goto("https://notebooklm.google.com/")` 302s to
`accounts.google.com/…/SignIn`, the login page sets a handful of anonymous cookies
(`NID`, `OTZ`, `__Host-GAPS`, `_ga`, …), and an unconditional `storage_state`
serializes **only those**, dropping every real auth cookie. The next cold start
finds a useless file and recovery requires a fresh interactive login. The rule for
any wrapper that owns its own persistence: **gate the write on a confirmed-authed
page URL, or better, on a successful library API call.**

```python
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient, AuthError


async def verify_and_save(context, STORAGE):
    try:
        async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
            await client.notebooks.list()  # confirms auth
    except (AuthError, ValueError):
        return  # don't overwrite a good file with a bad jar
    await context.storage_state(path=STORAGE)
```

The supported keepalive surfaces (`notebooklm auth refresh`, `keepalive=N`) already
gate their writes correctly.

### A5 · Open questions

- **Exact `*PSIDTS` stale-value acceptance distribution.** Acceptance varies by
  account, IP, Workspace policy, and extraction quality; longitudinal data would let
  us tune L2's 60 s floor more precisely.
- **DBSC enrollment status for Playwright-launched Chromium.** Assumed non-bound on
  macOS/Linux (no TPM), possibly bound on Windows; untested.
- **Whether `RotateBoundCookies` returns interpretable errors for unsigned
  attempts** — could let us detect a DBSC enforcement transition proactively rather
  than reactively.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-09 (recovery state owners and cycle removal)** — `SingleFlight`,
  `ColdRecoveryState`, and `RotationState` now own their registries/locks/epochs rather than
  module-global algorithms. `ColdRecoveryCoordinator` is the one-shot explicit L2.5/L3/L4 owner;
  cancellation cannot cancel sibling flight work, and quiescent resets reject live work. PSIDTS
  recovery now composes injected pure loaders, typed raw-document observation/CAS, and
  `ProfileStore` persistence without upward cookie/storage edges. `MasterTokenError`, `Account`,
  and the Playwright repair result moved to dependency-bottom value leaves while retaining their
  historical module/pickle and facade identities; one-shot account repair scrubs its six
  collaborators on every exit. The auth graph is 40 modules / 15,237 lines / 128 edges (117
  module + 11 function-local), and both module-only and all-scope SCC sets are empty. Final touched
  owner LOC: account 252, account-repair 132, account-types 50, cookie-types 396, cookies 961,
  keepalive 438, master-token 455, master-token-types 68, PSIDTS recovery 1,222, recovery 530,
  refresh 1,184, single-flight 268, storage 1,127.

- **2026-08-09 (typed refresh persistence)** — `fetch_tokens_with_domains` now consumes one paired
  live/SameSite-preserving baseline sample, retains the baseline selected by the initial/L2.5/L3/L4
  ladder, captures an immutable final observation, and dispatches one concrete `ProfileStore`
  merge. Hard results retain the exact input baseline; advancing results return the exact next
  baseline. Cancellation remains ordinary immediate `to_thread` propagation even though the
  worker may finish. Only the private refresh saver alias retired; public compatibility remains.
  At that Phase 12B checkpoint the auth graph was 38 modules / 15,074 lines / 122 edges (110 module + 12 local), with sole new
  edge `refresh -> profile_store`; measured owners are 389 lines in `recovery.py` and 1,189 in
  `refresh.py`.

- **2026-08-09 (cold recovery coordinator)** — The internal, one-shot
  `ColdRecoveryCoordinator` in `_auth/recovery.py` now owns the L2.5 decision/attempt and combined
  cold delegation. `refresh._cold_fallbacks` supplies the late-bound production closures and keeps
  exact skip/start/failure logging, route timing, retained-error precedence, cancellation timing,
  and same-sample snapshot/baseline results. Existing `_run_cold_recovery` remains the L3/L4 and
  per-loop lock/generation owner; its coalesced wrapper retained shared flights at that stage.
  Measured owners are 389 lines in `recovery.py` and 1,194 in `refresh.py`.

- **2026-08-09 (runtime profile-store cookie persistence)** — `FileLoadedAuth` now registers its
  exact store/baseline pair with first-party `CookiePersistence`; direct construction prepares one
  baseline before transport, with sticky typed failure and fileless compatibility-only capture.
  At that checkpoint untouched defaults used the private typed merge while custom/patched defaults
  retained the public legacy saver. B2 retired that identity fallback: only explicit overrides now
  initialize retryable per-key adapter snapshots.
  `ClientLifecycle` owns the v0.x `AuthTokens.cookie_snapshot` mirror after open and accepted saves;
  `_from_store` retains no `AuthTokens`. Measured owners are 457 lines in `_cookie_persistence.py`,
  618 in `_runtime/init.py`, 628 in `_runtime/lifecycle.py`, and 992 in `client.py`.

- **2026-08-09 (typed stored-auth loader and paired baseline)** — `_auth/tokens.py` now owns the
  captured-inline/file source split, paired seed/acquisition, per-attempt account route,
  `StoredAuthLoader`, and closed `LoadedAuth` result around the sole `TokenAcquirer` seam. One raw
  cookie sample supplies both the live jar and SameSite-preserving typed baseline; refresh and
  recovery replacements return their exact paired baselines. The initial store merge advances
  accepted-final/rejected-old state and retains the acquisition baseline on hard failure. The
  client consumes the closed result; Phase 10 registers its exact file store/baseline pair with
  runtime persistence. Measured loader owners were 816 lines in `tokens.py`, 1,195 in `refresh.py`,
  and 996 in `client.py` at that phase.

- **2026-08-09 (legacy account migration ownership and lifecycle)** —
  `_auth/profile_migration.py` now owns `LegacyAccountContext`, `LegacyAccountMigrator`,
  `LegacyPromotionScheduler`, `LoginProfileWriter`, and `AccountMetadataWriter`. Resolution retains
  the in-band/legacy/in-band anti-race sequence and a lossless raw compatibility projection;
  promotion remains only-if-absent and embed-before-scrub. The context owner retains its separate
  10-second `FileLock` and public atomic JSON write. Reads schedule canonical per-path single-flight
  daemon workers without waiting; settled paths are retryable and stale siblings beside in-band
  winners are scrubbed. The process exit hook drains workers within one shared
  budget (30 seconds by default, configurable), warning if any is still running
  when it expires.
  Login reconciles only after `APPLIED` and outside the profile lock; account write and clear keep
  their distinct scrub ordering. `_auth/storage.py` remains the v0.x signature/result facade. The
  measured boundary is 1,150 storage + 311 migration + 794 store + 96 filter = 2,351 lines. Loader,
  account-network, runtime, recovery, master-token, and shim ownership is unchanged by this stage.

- **2026-08-11 (native profile-replacement results)** — Browser capture now builds a
  `RemintWriteRequest` and consumes `ProfileStore.replace_from_remint` directly. Login/import app
  and CLI flows call the path-shaped `replace_profile_from_login` operation through the internal
  `notebooklm.auth` ledger, pass primitive keep/clear/set account modes, and consume the same
  value-free `ReplaceResult`. The v0.x `storage.replace_from_remint` and
  `storage.replace_from_login` signatures and return objects remain unchanged; exhaustive maps in
  that compatibility owner perform the only native-to-legacy status projection. PSIDTS recovery
  and ordinary lifecycle saves continue to consume `CookieMergeResult` directly. The auth graph is
  41 modules / 15,898 lines / 142 edges (130 module + 12 local), with no SCC.

- **2026-08-09 (profile-store minted-session replacement)** —
  `ProfileStore.replace_minted_session` now owns the authoritative same-lock latest-owner gate,
  default raw filter, lossless destination preservation/rebind, and one profile commit.
  `storage.persist_minted_jar` remains the exact v0.x adapter: it snapshots raw cookie fields plus
  email before lock work and projects private refusal to canonical context-free `MasterTokenError`;
  `master_token.persist_minted_jar` remains the public late-lookup wrapper. Corruption/unknown/force,
  custom paths, exception messages, locks, permissions, on-disk schema, and callers are otherwise
  unchanged. At that stage, legacy migration/composition and token value/file/network/bootstrap
  ownership had not moved.

- **2026-08-09 (profile-store login/import replacement)** —
  `ProfileStore.replace_from_login` now owns raw source filtering, required-name rejection before
  destination reads, KEEP/SET/CLEAR namespace construction, optional inside-lock backup, and the
  single profile commit. `storage.replace_from_login` remains the exact v0.x facade/patch identity
  and, at that stage, directly performed post-APPLIED legacy promote-or-scrub outside the profile
  lock. KEEP carries the whole raw source namespace; SET/CLEAR rebuild it. No schema, path,
  permission, warning,
  backup, result, or caller behavior changed.

- **2026-08-08 (profile-store browser/remint replacement)** — The pure raw
  capture/domain filter and value-free malformed-row diagnostics now live in
  `_auth/cookie_filter.py`. `ProfileStore.replace_from_remint` owns the bounded
  transaction, latest raw namespace carry, filtering, and commit;
  `_auth/storage.py::replace_from_remint` remains the exact v0.x adapter and
  browser patch seam. At that stage, login/minted replacement, legacy reconciliation and
  scheduling, and token policy still lived in `_auth/storage.py`. No schema, path,
  lock, permission, backup, warning, or public-result behavior changed.

- **2026-08-08 (profile-store account intents)** — `ProfileStore` now owns typed
  in-band account read/update/clear and their distinct corruption/lock policies.
  At that stage, `_auth/storage.py` kept raw compatibility, legacy promotion scheduling, and
  sibling scrub; all full replacements and token-file policy remained there. The
  empty-placeholder promotion correction changes no schema, path, permission,
  backup, log, or public API.

- **2026-08-05 (storage-writer / recovery-ladder refactor sync)** — Reflects the
  auth-audit refactor in [#2091](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/pull/2091)
  (companion [ADR-0029](adr/0029-canonical-storage-writer.md) canonical storage
  writer + [ADR-0030](adr/0030-one-recovery-ladder.md) one recovery ladder):
  `_auth/storage.py` is now the sole writer of `storage_state.json` on one
  unified 90 s lock, fail-closed for full-replace writes and fail-open for the CAS
  cookie merge (§A2); cold-start L3/L4 recovery and the `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`
  rung now coalesce across event loops **and** processes through the new
  `_auth/single_flight.py` core instead of two independently hand-rolled,
  same-loop-only implementations (§4, §5.3, §6.2); `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD` gained
  an opt-in mid-session firing mode (`NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD_MIDSESSION`) plus
  output-logging and secret-scrub hardening (§6.2); and the inline PSIDTS
  cold-start recovery (§5.4) now runs off the event loop for async callers via a
  pure-loader/wrapper split, with its decision rules unchanged byte-for-byte. The
  public L1–L7 taxonomy, the empirical cookie-requirements findings (§3.3), and the
  cookie-policy predicates are unaffected — this was an internal
  coalescing/locking consolidation, not a change to what Google accepts or how the
  ladder is presented to users.
- **2026-07-04 (v0.8.0 rewrite)** — Restructured and trimmed for the v0.8.0
  release. Now leads with the master-token headless path (L4) as the recommended
  approach for unattended / headless / server / CI use, adds an early
  [Available auth methods](#available-auth-methods) comparison and a
  [Recommended setup](#recommended-setup) section, and consolidates the recovery
  ladder onto the single canonical **L1–L7** taxonomy shared with
  troubleshooting.md — reflecting the integrated L3 headless re-auth and L4
  master-token re-mint. Corrected the prior status blockquote, relabeled
  browser-cookie extraction (a variant of L6 / a common L5 command, **not** L4),
  removed the obsolete "L5-A" label, and updated the `NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`
  scope note to "orthogonal to L1–L4". Dated empirical claims (specific probe
  runs, hour-counts, month-stamped DBSC timeline) were replaced with durable,
  timeless statements. The internal cookie-jar-fidelity hazard log, the
  `RotateCookies`-vs-`CheckCookie` deep dive, the ruled-out experiments, and the
  ecosystem comparison were compressed into the
  [Appendix](#appendix-field-notes--historical-findings).
- **Earlier revisions (2026-05 → 2026-06)** — initial writeup and field experiment;
  merged-code sync (L1 `RotateCookies` POST, three-guard throttle); §2 background
  (cookie taxonomy, rotation model, DBSC, extraction); internal-threat
  cookie-jar-fidelity analysis; domain tiering (REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL); path-aware
  persistence follow-ups. Superseded by the v0.8.0 rewrite above; see git history
  for the full detail.
