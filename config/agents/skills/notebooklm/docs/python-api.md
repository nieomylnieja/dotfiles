# Python API Reference

**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** 2026-08-14

Complete reference for the `notebooklm` Python library.

See also:
- [Architecture Guide](./architecture.md) for structural overview, capability protocols, and transport design.
- [RPC Development Guide](./rpc-development.md) for custom RPC design, protocols, and mock assertions.

## Quick Start

```python
import asyncio
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient

async def main():
    # Create client from saved authentication
    async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
        # List notebooks
        notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
        print(f"Found {len(notebooks)} notebooks")

        # Create a new notebook
        nb = await client.notebooks.create("My Research")
        print(f"Created: {nb.id}")

        # Add sources
        await client.sources.add_url(nb.id, "https://example.com/article")

        # Ask a question
        result = await client.chat.ask(nb.id, "Summarize the main points")
        print(result.answer)

        # Generate a podcast
        status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(nb.id)
        await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb.id, status.task_id)
        output_path = await client.artifacts.download_audio(nb.id, "podcast.m4a")
        print(f"Audio saved to: {output_path}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Core Concepts

### Concurrency model

`NotebookLMClient` is **async re-entrant on a single event loop**. You can freely await multiple operations concurrently via `asyncio.gather` or `asyncio.TaskGroup`:

```python
notebooks, sources = await asyncio.gather(
    client.notebooks.list(),
    client.sources.list(notebook_id),
)
```

The client is **not thread-safe**. Do not share a `NotebookLMClient` across threads or across multiple event loops. Create one client per loop. A loop-affinity guard raises a clear `RuntimeError` on the authed POST hot path if you do — see the [Concurrency contract](#concurrency-contract) section below for the full guarantees, non-guarantees, and production patterns.

If we ever provide thread-safety, it will be a versioned, opt-in API change. Do not assume it.

### Async Context Manager

The client must be used as an async context manager to properly manage HTTP connections:

```python
# Canonical idiom (v0.5.0+) - no `await` on `from_storage`.
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    ...

# Legacy idiom (deprecated, removed in v1.0) - works but emits
# DeprecationWarning. Drop the `await` to migrate.
async with await NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    ...

# Manual management - still works; the await emits DeprecationWarning.
# Migrate to `async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage()` instead.
client = await NotebookLMClient.from_storage()
await client.__aenter__()
try:
    ...
finally:
    await client.__aexit__(None, None, None)
```

### Authentication

The client requires valid Google session cookies obtained via browser login:

```python
# From storage file (recommended) — use as an async context manager:
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    ...
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage("/path/to/storage_state.json") as client:
    ...

# From a named profile
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(profile="work") as client:
    ...

# Permit one cold-start L3 browser recovery if cookies are fully expired.
# A sibling master_token.json can recover automatically without this flag.
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(profile="work", allow_headless=True) as client:
    ...

# Headless: mint cookies from a durable master token (the [headless] extra),
# then drive the normal client. No per-session browser; expired sessions
# re-mint automatically when master_token.json sits beside storage_state.json.
# (One-time bootstrap: `notebooklm login --master-token --account you@gmail.com`.)
from notebooklm.auth import master_token_remint
from notebooklm.paths import get_storage_path

await master_token_remint(get_storage_path())               # read -> mint -> persist -> reload
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    ...
# ⚠️ The master token is a full-account, durable credential — dedicated account only.
#
# The lower-level primitives (read_master_token / mint_cookies /
# persist_minted_jar / write_master_token / generate_android_id /
# exchange_master_token) remain importable from notebooklm.auth for callers
# that need to assemble a custom transaction, but master_token_remint is the
# audited, recommended path — it also enforces the account-ownership guard
# (refuses to overwrite a DIFFERENT account's session) that assembling the
# primitives yourself bypasses.

# From AuthTokens directly
from notebooklm import AuthTokens
auth = AuthTokens(
    cookies={"SID": "...", "HSID": "..."},  # (other cookies elided for brevity)
    csrf_token="...",
    session_id="...",
)
client = NotebookLMClient(auth)

```

`AuthTokens.from_storage(...)` remains available as a v0.x compatibility loader,
but it is deprecated in v0.8.1 and emits `DeprecationWarning` when awaited. Use
the managed `NotebookLMClient.from_storage(...)` examples above and access
`client.auth` while the client is open. It is scheduled for removal in v1.0.

Constructing `AuthTokens(..., storage_path=..., cookie_jar=None)` also remains
compatible through v0.x, but its implicit synchronous storage/recovery I/O is
deprecated on the same schedule. Prefer the managed client; low-level callers
that already own a live jar should pass `cookie_jar=` explicitly.

The v0.8.1 cookie-view runway preserves the `AuthTokens` constructor and dataclass
behavior while moving managed clients toward one live authority:

| Surface | v0.8.1 behavior and migration |
|---|---|
| `flat_cookies` | Direct access warns because the name-only map loses domain/path siblings. Use `jar` for bootstrap-cookie questions and managed client APIs for requests. |
| `cookies`, `cookie_jar` | Docs-only deprecated compatibility fields. They cannot warn without making construction, repr, equality, and `dataclasses.replace()` noisy. |
| `jar` | Warning-free transitional shape for the v1 immutable `initial_cookies: CookieJar` bootstrap field. |
| `cookie_header`, `cookie_header_for(url)` | Scheduled for v1 deletion; use managed client request APIs. Both remain warning-free in v0.x. |

`CookieJar` is an immutable, ordered sequence of `Cookie` rows—not a mapping and
not a live transport jar. Iteration yields rows, `len()` counts rows, and
duplicate names on different domain/path routes remain distinct.

**Building a storage state from existing browser cookies (`[cookies]` extra):**

Install with the optional `cookies` extra to pull cookies from a locally installed browser via [rookiepy](https://pypi.org/project/rookiepy/) — useful for headless environments where you cannot run Playwright (full extras matrix: [docs/installation.md#optional-extras-matrix](installation.md#optional-extras-matrix)):

```bash
pip install "notebooklm-py[cookies]"
```

```python
import json
import os
import rookiepy
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient
from notebooklm.auth import (
    REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS,
    convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state,
)

# Pull Google cookies from Chrome (or .firefox(), .edge(), .safari(), .load() for auto-detect).
# REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS mirrors the CLI's extraction set so rotation, media
# downloads, and Drive flows all have the cookies they need.
raw = rookiepy.chrome(domains=list(REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS))
storage_state = convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state(raw)

# Persist for future runs; restrict to owner-only on POSIX since this file holds auth cookies
storage_path = "/path/to/storage_state.json"
with open(storage_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(storage_state, f)
if os.name != "nt":
    os.chmod(storage_path, 0o600)

async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(storage_path) as client:
    notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
```

`convert_rookiepy_cookies_to_storage_state(rookiepy_cookies)` converts the
cookie list returned by `rookiepy` into the storage-state format
`NotebookLMClient.from_storage()` expects:

- **Key remap:** `http_only` → `httpOnly`, `expires=None` →
  `expires=-1` (Playwright's session-cookie convention), `sameSite="None"`.
- **Filtering:** cookies missing `name`/`value`/`domain`, or from domains
  outside the auth allowlist (regional Google ccTLDs + `REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS`
  ∪ `OPTIONAL_COOKIE_DOMAINS`), are silently skipped.
- **Return:** `{"cookies": [...], "origins": []}` — drop straight into
  `storage_state.json`.

Cookie extraction (and Google-account selection) happens in the
`rookiepy.<browser>(...)` call: the storage state reflects whichever Google
account is currently active in the source browser. To pick up cookies for
optional surfaces (YouTube, Docs, MyAccount, Mail), extend the rookiepy
`domains=` argument with `OPTIONAL_COOKIE_DOMAINS` (or a label-specific
subset via `OPTIONAL_COOKIE_DOMAINS_BY_LABEL`) — both imported from
`notebooklm.auth` alongside `REQUIRED_COOKIE_DOMAINS`. The CLI equivalent
is `notebooklm login --browser-cookies <browser> [--include-domains youtube,docs,...]`.

**Environment Variable Support:**

The library respects these environment variables for authentication:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NOTEBOOKLM_HOME` | Base directory for config files (default: `~/.notebooklm`) |
| `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` | Active profile name (default: `default`) |
| `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` | Inline auth JSON - no file needed (for CI/CD) |

**Precedence** (highest to lowest):
1. Explicit `path` argument to `from_storage()`
2. `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON` environment variable
3. Explicit `profile` argument to `from_storage(profile="work")`
4. `NOTEBOOKLM_PROFILE` environment variable (resolves to `~/.notebooklm/profiles/<name>/storage_state.json`)
5. Active profile from `default_profile` in `~/.notebooklm/config.json`
6. `~/.notebooklm/profiles/default/storage_state.json`
7. `~/.notebooklm/storage_state.json` (legacy fallback)

**CI/CD Example:**
```python
import os

# Set auth JSON from environment (e.g., GitHub Actions secret)
os.environ["NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON"] = '{"cookies": [...]}'

# Client automatically uses the env var
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
```

### Error Handling

The library raises `RPCError` for API failures:

```python
from notebooklm import RPCError

try:
    result = await client.notebooks.create("Test")
except RPCError as e:
    print(f"RPC failed: {e}")
    # Common causes:
    # - Session expired (re-run `notebooklm login`)
    # - Rate limited (wait and retry)
    # - Invalid parameters
```

#### Exception hierarchy at a glance

All library exceptions inherit from `NotebookLMError`. RPC/protocol-level
failures live under `RPCError`; per-domain failures live under
`NotebookError`, `SourceError`, `ArtifactError`, etc. (`NetworkError` is
deliberately outside `RPCError` — it represents transport-level failures
that happen before any RPC is dispatched.) The three "not found" exceptions
sit at the intersection — they're catchable as **any** of `NotFoundError`
(cross-domain umbrella), `RPCError`, or the domain base:

| Exception | Catchable as |
|---|---|
| `NotebookNotFoundError` | `NotFoundError`, `RPCError`, `NotebookError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `SourceNotFoundError` | `NotFoundError`, `RPCError`, `SourceError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `ArtifactNotFoundError` | `NotFoundError`, `RPCError`, `ArtifactError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `NoteNotFoundError` | `NotFoundError`, `RPCError`, `NoteError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `MindMapNotFoundError` | `NotFoundError`, `RPCError`, `MindMapError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError` | `RPCError`, `ArtifactError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `SourceTimeoutError` | `WaitTimeoutError`, `TimeoutError`, `SourceError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `ArtifactTimeoutError` | `WaitTimeoutError`, `TimeoutError`, `ArtifactError`, `NotebookLMError` |
| `ResearchTimeoutError` | `WaitTimeoutError`, `TimeoutError`, `ResearchError`, `NotebookLMError` |

`MindMapNotFoundError` is raised by `client.mind_maps.get(...)` and mutation
paths such as `rename` on a missing target. `NoteNotFoundError` is raised by
`client.notes.get(...)` when the note is absent.

Use the table to pick the right level of catch. As of **v0.8.0** (the #1247
flip), `client.sources.get(...)`, `client.artifacts.get(...)`,
`client.notes.get(...)`, and `client.mind_maps.get(...)` **raise** the matching
`*NotFoundError` (`SourceNotFoundError` / `ArtifactNotFoundError` /
`NoteNotFoundError` / `MindMapNotFoundError`) on a missing entity — matching
`client.notebooks.get(...)`, which raises `NotebookNotFoundError`. The previous
`None`-on-miss return (deprecated with a `DeprecationWarning` through v0.7.0) is
gone; migrate any `if result is None:` check to `try/except
<Resource>NotFoundError`, or use the paired `get_or_none(...)` (below) for the
sanctioned `None`-on-miss contract. See [`deprecations.md`](deprecations.md) and
issue #1247. `client.mind_maps.get(...)` was the last
namespace in the #1247 cohort without a runway; use `client.mind_maps.get_or_none(...)`
for the warning-free `None`-on-miss contract. If you genuinely want
`None`-on-miss after the flip, every namespace now offers a paired
`get_or_none(...)` (`client.notebooks.get_or_none(nb_id)`,
`client.sources.get_or_none(nb_id, source_id)`, and likewise for `artifacts`,
`notes`, and `mind_maps`) — the sanctioned, warning-free `None`-on-miss lookup.
It returns `None` for a genuine absence and re-raises transport, auth, and
decode faults rather than swallowing them. (The one documented carve-out is
`artifacts`, which inherits `client.artifacts.list(...)`'s deliberate
partial-availability behavior: a transport failure of the mind-map sub-fetch is
logged and the studio artifacts that loaded are still returned — see ADR-0019
Rule 3.)

For `notebooks` specifically, gRPC status `5` reaches `None` under **both** its
meanings: the notebook is genuinely absent, or it exists under a different
signed-in Google account (the account-routing case behind issues #114 / #294).
The backend sends the same status either way, so `get_or_none()` cannot
distinguish them and the routing guidance is unobservable there. Use
`client.notebooks.get(...)` when that matters — it raises
`NotebookNotFoundError` carrying the guidance in its message, the originating
`rpc_code`, and the original rejection as `__cause__`. `PERMISSION_DENIED`
(status `7`) is never folded into `None` and always propagates. The workflows that
*already* raise `SourceNotFoundError` are `client.sources.get_fulltext(...)` and
`client.sources.wait_until_ready(...)`. Artifact-download workflows raise
`ArtifactNotFoundError` when a requested artifact ID is not in the listing.
Artifact generation workflows may raise `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError`
when NotebookLM accepts the RPC but returns no generation task for a specific
artifact feature. For infographic generation, a null `CREATE_ARTIFACT` result
is reported this way instead of surfacing as schema drift or a failed
`GenerationStatus`.

`client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(...)` raises
`ArtifactPendingTimeoutError` when a task stays queued and never reaches
`in_progress`, or `ArtifactInProgressTimeoutError` when it starts but does not
finish before `timeout`. Both subclass `ArtifactTimeoutError` and built-in
`TimeoutError`. The exception exposes `task_id`, `notebook_id`,
`timeout_seconds`, `last_status`, `stalled_phase`, `status_history`, and
`status_transitions` so callers can retry, fail soft, or log upstream queueing
patterns without parsing the message.

The CLI defaults to longer wait budgets for media generation (`audio`: 1200s,
`video`: 1800s, `cinematic-video`: 3600s). In Python, pass the same budget
explicitly with `wait_for_completion(..., timeout=...)`.

##### WaitTimeoutError

`WaitTimeoutError` (added in v0.7.0) is the cross-domain umbrella for every
`wait_*` / polling timeout. It mixes in the built-in `TimeoutError`, so
existing `except TimeoutError` clauses keep working unchanged, and it is the
common base of `SourceTimeoutError`, `ArtifactTimeoutError` (and its
`ArtifactPendingTimeoutError` / `ArtifactInProgressTimeoutError` subclasses),
and `ResearchTimeoutError`. Catch it once to handle a wait timeout from any
domain in a single clause:

```python
from notebooklm import WaitTimeoutError

try:
    ready = await client.sources.wait_until_ready(nb_id, src_id)
    status = await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb_id, task_id)
    result = await client.research.wait_for_completion(nb_id, research_task_id)
except WaitTimeoutError as exc:
    # Catches SourceTimeoutError, ArtifactTimeoutError, ResearchTimeoutError.
    log.warning("wait timed out: %s", exc)
```

`ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion` previously raised the bare built-in
`TimeoutError`; it now raises `ResearchTimeoutError`, which is a
`WaitTimeoutError` (and therefore still a `TimeoutError`), so the change is
backward-compatible. The poll cadence keyword on that method is
`initial_interval=` (matching the source/artifact waiters); the old `interval=`
alias was removed in v0.8.0. See [deprecations](deprecations.md#removed-in-v080).

##### Catching any "not found" across domains

`NotFoundError` is the cross-domain umbrella. Catch it to handle any
"resource not found" case uniformly:

```python
from notebooklm import NotFoundError

try:
    notebook = await client.notebooks.get(nb_id)
    source = await client.sources.wait_until_ready(nb_id, src_id)
    await client.artifacts.download_audio(nb_id, dest, audio_id)
except NotFoundError as e:
    # Catches NotebookNotFoundError, SourceNotFoundError,
    # and ArtifactNotFoundError uniformly.
    print(f"Missing resource: {e}")
```

#### Processing failures vs. timeouts

`SourceProcessingError` means *this source will not become ready*; `SourceTimeoutError` means *it had not become ready yet*. The distinction matters because only the second is worth waiting on again.

A source whose `type_code` is audio (`10`) or still unclassified (`0` / `None`) may report `status=ERROR` briefly while it is being transcribed or classified, so the waiters tolerate that rather than failing fast. That tolerance is bounded by your `timeout`: if the last status observed was `ERROR` and the poll then ran out of time, the waiters raise **`SourceProcessingError`**, not `SourceTimeoutError` ([#2138](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2138)). The source answered `ERROR` repeatedly until the deadline; reporting that as a timeout would invite an endless retry.

This is the route a file whose *processing* fails takes. `add_file()` returns as soon as the bytes are transferred — with `wait=False` (the default) it does not poll at all, and the `status=PROCESSING` on the returned `Source` is a placeholder, not an observation. So a post-transfer processing failure is only ever visible through a wait:

```python
from notebooklm import SourceProcessingError, SourceTimeoutError

source = await client.sources.add_file(nb_id, "recording.wav")
try:
    ready = await client.sources.wait_until_ready(nb_id, source.id, timeout=300)
except SourceProcessingError as exc:
    # Terminal: the format was rejected, the content was unreadable, etc.
    # The row is retained server-side; see the reconciliation note below.
    print(f"will not become ready: {exc}")
except SourceTimeoutError:
    print("still processing; poll again later")
```

Pass `wait=True` to have `add_file()` do this for you.

**Reconciling what a failed add left behind.** A row registered by an add that then failed is deliberately *not* deleted — it is the evidence, and it still counts against the notebook's source quota. It sits at `SourceStatus.PREPARING`, not `ERROR`, so filtering for error status will not find it:

```python
from notebooklm import SourceStatus

stuck = [s for s in await client.sources.list(nb_id) if s.status is SourceStatus.PREPARING]
```

(or `notebooklm source list --status preparing` from the CLI). Rows genuinely mid-upload also report `PREPARING`, so re-read before deleting. When the failing add raised in your own process you do not need to search: the exception carries the id directly, as `getattr(exc, "source_id", None)`.

Methods that *raise* a `*NotFoundError` on not-found include every namespace
`get()` (as of v0.8.0 — `client.notebooks.get`, `client.sources.get`,
`client.artifacts.get`, `client.notes.get`, `client.mind_maps.get`),
`client.sources.get_fulltext`, `client.sources.wait_until_ready`, and the
artifact download paths. For a `None`-on-miss lookup that does *not* trigger the
umbrella, use the paired `get_or_none(...)`.

##### Ordering matters

Python checks `except` clauses top to bottom. To get distinct handlers for
"missing resource" vs other RPC failures, list the specific subclass first:

```python
from notebooklm import (
    ArtifactNotFoundError,
    NotebookNotFoundError,
    RPCError,
    SourceNotFoundError,
)

try:
    fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(notebook_id, source_id)
except SourceNotFoundError:
    # Specific handler runs first.
    ...
except RPCError:
    # Catches every other RPC failure: auth, rate limit, decode, etc.
    ...
```

> **v0.6.0 BREAKING CHANGE.** Before v0.6.0, only `NotebookNotFoundError`
> mixed in `RPCError`; `SourceNotFoundError` and `ArtifactNotFoundError` did
> not. In 0.5.x, `except RPCError` did NOT catch a missing source or
> artifact, so a downstream `except SourceNotFoundError` / `except
> ArtifactNotFoundError` clause caught it instead. In 0.6.0, `except
> RPCError` now catches all three uniformly — if it's listed first, any
> downstream `*NotFoundError` clauses become unreachable. Reorder your
> `except` clauses to put the specific exceptions first.

### Authentication & Token Refresh

**Automatic Refresh:** The client automatically refreshes CSRF tokens when authentication errors are detected. This happens transparently during any API call - you don't need to handle it manually.

When an RPC call fails with an auth error (HTTP 401/403 or auth-related message):
1. The client fetches fresh tokens from the NotebookLM homepage
2. Waits briefly to avoid rate limiting
3. Retries the failed request automatically

**Manual Refresh:** For proactive refresh (e.g., before a long-running operation):

```python
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    # Manually refresh CSRF token and session ID
    await client.refresh_auth()
```

**Note:** If your session cookies have fully expired (not just CSRF tokens), you'll need to re-run `notebooklm login`.

### Idempotency

**Probe-then-retry for create operations.** When a network or server error (5xx / 429 / connection drop) interrupts a create call, the client surfaces the failure immediately rather than blindly retrying. For the methods listed below, the client then probes the server to discover whether the resource was already created before attempting a retry. This prevents duplicate resources when the server accepted the request but the response was lost in transit. The probe runs automatically — no opt-in keyword is required.

The following methods are idempotent under retry:

| Method | Probe |
|---|---|
| `client.notebooks.create(title)` | Snapshot notebook IDs *before*, list *after* a transport failure, return the single **new** notebook with the matching title (or raise on ambiguity). Titles are not unique, so an unfiltered match could hand back a notebook that predates the call — and every later `sources.add_*` / `chat.ask` in the session would then target it ([#2232](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2232)). |
| `client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, url)` | Snapshot source IDs *before*, list *after* a transport failure, return the single **new** source whose `url` exactly matches (or raise on ambiguity). The same URL can legitimately appear twice in one notebook, so an unfiltered match could hand back a source that predates the call ([#2204](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2204)). |
| `client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, youtube_url)` | Same probe; the backend echoes the requested YouTube URL back verbatim, short (`youtu.be/…`) forms included. |

`client.sources.add_text(notebook_id, title, content)` is **not** retry-safe: text sources lack a reliable server-side dedupe key (titles aren't unique; content isn't exposed in the source list). The default behavior is unchanged from previous releases. If you want explicit failure rather than possible silent duplication on retry, opt in:

```python
from notebooklm import NonIdempotentRetryError

try:
    await client.sources.add_text(nb_id, "Title", "Content", idempotent=True)
except NonIdempotentRetryError:
    # Embed a UUID in the title and dedupe client-side instead.
    ...
```

`client.sources.add_file(...)` and `client.sources.add_drive(...)` are now also covered by the probe-then-create wrapper: the create RPC runs with `disable_internal_retries=True` and, on transport failure, the wrapper probes the server-side source list (via `idempotent_create`) before deciding whether to retry — so transient failures no longer produce duplicate sources. See `_source/add.py` (`SourceAddService.add_drive`) and `_source/upload.py` (`SourceUploadPipeline.register_file_source`) for the implementation.

**When the probe itself fails, the call fails ([#2220](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2220)).** The probe is what makes the retry safe, so it is never allowed to guess. If its own list RPC fails for a non-transport reason — realistically, wire drift making the strict decoder raise `RPCError` — no **further** attempt is made, and you get `SourceAddError` (source paths) or `RPCError` (`notebooks.create`) saying the create could not be confirmed. Note "further": the wrapper allows two attempts, so if an *earlier* probe returned a clean "no match" one retry may already have gone out before this one failed — reconcile for more than one row.

Such an error carries an **`unconfirmed` attribute**. Test that, not the message text and not the exception type — it is the supported discriminator, and the same one the MCP and REST adapters use to keep these out of the "retry me" and "just this item failed" buckets.

**Type is the wrong discriminator here**, which is why the example below catches broadly. A probe whose list fails at the transport level re-raises that failure *unchanged*, so an unconfirmed create can reach you as `SourceAddError`, `RPCError`, `ServerError`, `NetworkError`, `RateLimitError`, or `AuthError`. Only the attribute is common to all of them.

```python
# Capture the ids BEFORE the add. A URL is not unique within a notebook, so a
# post-hoc match alone cannot tell "my create landed" from "a copy was already
# here" — adopting one blindly is the very bug #2204 fixed inside the library.
before = {s.id for s in await client.sources.list(nb_id)}

try:
    source = await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, url)
except Exception as exc:
    if not getattr(exc, "unconfirmed", False):
        raise  # a rejection, an auth failure, a plain outage — handle as usual
    # The create may or may not have landed. Only a source that is BOTH new
    # since the snapshot and matching the URL is attributable to this call.
    new = [s for s in await client.sources.list(nb_id) if s.id not in before and s.url == url]
    if len(new) == 1:
        source = new[0]                       # attributable to this call
    elif not new:
        # NOT proof the create failed — the source list lags the write, so a
        # committed source can be missing here and appear moments later. Re-read
        # before concluding anything; see the caveat below.
        raise
    else:
        raise  # several new matches — cannot attribute. Resolve by hand.
```

Three caveats on that reconciliation, all inherent to a list-based probe rather than to this example:

- **An empty result is not proof the create failed.** Source-list visibility lags the write: the library's own `test_add_url_probe_matches_on_the_second_attempt` models a committed source that is absent from the first post-create `GET_NOTEBOOK` and appears only on the next one. Re-issuing on a single empty read is how a duplicate gets made — poll the list a few times before deciding, and if it stays empty, prefer surfacing the situation over an automatic re-add.
- **A single new match is *attributable*, not *proven*.** A snapshot establishes *when* a source appeared, not *who* created it. If another client adds the same URL after your snapshot while your own create never lands, you will see exactly one new match and adopt their source — the two-match branch never fires. `add_url`'s own docstring carries the same warning: the wire has no client-supplied idempotency key, so serialize concurrent adds of the same URL into one notebook if you need that guarantee, or treat the single-match case as unresolved too.
- **The reconciling `sources.list()` can itself fail.** If the outage that broke the probe is still going, this whole block raises, which is the correct outcome — still unresolved.

The attribute is set on more than just the "probe raised" case. It marks every way a probe fails to settle whether the create landed: a match it cannot attribute because the pre-create baseline was unavailable, several new matches it cannot choose between, or a create that returned success with no trustworthy id whose recovery probe then came up empty. Those raise without anything having thrown inside the probe, so they look like ordinary rejections — but the server may hold a row either way.

It is absent on every other failure, so `getattr(exc, "unconfirmed", False)` is safe to call unconditionally.

**The exception chain has three shapes** — worth knowing before diagnostic code goes looking in a fixed place:

| how it arose | the exception you catch | the create's transport failure |
|---|---|---|
| probe failed with a non-transport error (e.g. a decode `RPCError`) | a wrapper naming the source, with the probe's failure as `__cause__` | at `__context__.__context__` |
| probe failed with a transport/auth error (`ServerError`, `NetworkError`, `RateLimitError`, `AuthError`) | **that same error, re-raised unchanged and marked** | at `__context__` |
| `add_file` only: the register RPC returned **200** but carried no trustworthy `SOURCE_ID`, so the recovery probe ran directly | a wrapper naming the file | **none — no create failure exists**; a probe error, if any, is at `__cause__` |

The third shape breaks a fixed-depth assumption outright: `_create` calls the probe itself rather than being driven by the retry wrapper, so no transport failure exists anywhere in the chain, and a no-match or ambiguity yields a marked `SourceAddError` with no `__cause__` at all. In the second shape there is no wrapper either, so `__cause__` is whatever the transport layer already set (often absent). Walk the `__context__` chain rather than assuming a depth, and treat both `__cause__` and `__context__` as optional.

The alternative — retrying on an unanswered probe — is what this replaced. It recovered silently in the common case, at the cost of occasionally handing back a duplicate, or the wrong source id, with nothing to signal it. A raised error is actionable; an unreported duplicate is not.

**Partial file uploads.** File registration creates the source row before the
resumable HTTP upload starts. If session setup or the combined upload/finalize
request then fails, the source row is **retained** — the client never deletes it
automatically.

The failure is raised as **its own type, unwrapped**: `AuthError` on an expired
session, `RateLimitError` on a 429, `ServerError` on a 5xx, `NetworkError` on a
dropped connection, `ValidationError` on a rejected file, or a bare
`SourceAddError`. An existing `except ValidationError:` around `add_file()` keeps
working unchanged — there is no new exception type to catch.

To identify the retained row, read the `source_id` and `stage` attributes the
client attaches to that exception. They are present *only* on a
post-registration upload failure, so read them defensively:

```python
try:
    source = await client.sources.add_file(nb_id, "report.pdf")
except NotebookLMError as error:
    source_id = getattr(error, "source_id", None)
    if source_id is not None:
        # A row was registered and left behind; reconcile it, then remove it with
        # client.sources.delete(nb_id, source_id) if it is unusable.
        print(source_id, error.stage)  # stage: "start_session" | "upload_finalize"
    raise
```

`stage` says **where** the failure happened, not whether any bytes were sent: it
advances to `"upload_finalize"` before the body request is issued, so a
connection that drops before the first byte still reports that stage.
Cancellation still propagates as `CancelledError`, with no attributes attached.

A raw transport failure is the one case where the raised exception is not the
original object: an `httpx.RequestError` is normalised to a library
`NetworkError` first (the httpx exception on its `original_error`, and
`__cause__` still the raw `httpx.RequestError`), so a dropped connection reaches
you as a library exception rather than a raw `httpx` error — which is what makes
it classify as retryable infrastructure instead of a rejected input.

Everything else propagates as itself. The post-registration handler catches
`Exception`, so a local file-read `OSError` or an exception raised by your own
`on_progress` callback also arrives carrying `source_id` / `stage`; give any
`isinstance` chain over the caught exception a fallback branch.

## Concurrency contract

This section is the canonical answer to "is `NotebookLMClient` safe to use from
multiple coroutines / threads / processes / event loops?" The concurrency model
documented here has been hardened to support high-concurrency programmatic
clients (long-running agents, parallel `asyncio.gather` over many notebooks,
multi-process fleets).

If you only read one subsection, read **[Non-guarantees](#non-guarantees)** —
the guard rails are narrow.

### Guarantees

**Per-loop async safety.** A `NotebookLMClient` instance is bound to the
event loop on which it was opened. A loop-affinity guard checks
the active loop on the authed POST hot path — `rpc_call()` →
`query_post()` → `_perform_authed_post()` — and raises a clear `RuntimeError`
when the instance is re-used from a different loop. **Scope limitation:** the
guard fires on the hot path only. `ChatAPI.ask` adds its own
`assert_bound_loop()` check as its first statement, so cross-loop chat raises the
same friendly loop-affinity `RuntimeError`. One cold path remains:

- `close()` awaits `save_cookies` + `aclose` and never routes through
  `_perform_authed_post` or a loop guard; a cross-loop close gets a deep asyncio
  `RuntimeError` — opaque, not the friendly loop-affinity message.

**Best practice:** one client per loop, full stop.

**Refresh deduplication**. Concurrent RPCs that all
trigger a token refresh share a single underlying refresh attempt via
`_refresh_lock` + `asyncio.shield`. Waiter cancellation does not kill the
shared refresh task; the next caller in line picks up the finished tokens.

**Request-ID monotonicity**. `next_reqid()` returns a monotonic
sequence across concurrent coroutines on the same client. Guarded by
`_reqid_lock`.

**Per-attempt and across-attempt auth snapshot atomicity**.
`_auth_snapshot_lock` serializes `AuthSnapshot` reads against the
refresh-side mutation block — without this, a token refresh that
completed between the URL-build step and the POST step could produce a
URL stitched together from a mix of pre- and post-refresh credentials
(stale `session_id`, fresh `authuser`, etc.), which Google rejects with
an opaque auth error. `_build_url` consumes the snapshot rather than
reading live `session_id` / `authuser` / `account_email` fields, so the
URL and the headers come from a single consistent auth tuple. (This
obsoletes the warning in the older "Concurrency model" subsection
above.)

**Idempotent create RPCs**. The following calls are
idempotent under retry via probe-then-create (when `idempotent=True`,
which is the default):

- `client.notebooks.create(title)`
- `client.sources.add_url(notebook_id, url)` (YouTube URLs are auto-detected
  and routed through the YouTube source pathway internally)

`client.sources.add_text(notebook_id, title, content)` is **declared
non-idempotent**: text sources lack a reliable server-side dedupe key
(Google permits duplicate titles, and content is not exposed in source
listings). With `idempotent=True` it raises `NonIdempotentRetryError`. If
you set `disable_internal_retries=True` on the client, the probe-then-retry
wrapper is skipped entirely and the caller is responsible for retry
semantics.

**Cancellation safety.** Several paths are now shielded against
cancellation:

- **`close()`** is shielded; Ctrl-C during shutdown will not leak the
  underlying `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- **`refresh_auth()`** runs the shared refresh task under `asyncio.shield`;
  cancelling a waiter does not kill the shared refresh.
- **`get_account_email(live_fallback=True)`** returns the signed-in Google account
  email (or `None`): the in-memory `AuthTokens` / persisted profile metadata first
  (network-free), then — when `live_fallback` and the client is open — a single
  `WIZ_global_data` page probe that's persisted back for next time. Never raises for
  network/on-disk faults. `get_account_authuser()` returns the matching account
  index (0 = default), network-free.
- **Upload finalize** is shielded; on cancel signal we issue a best-effort
  Scotty (Google's internal resumable upload service) cancel to release the
  server-side upload slot.
- **`notes.create`** shields the `UPDATE_NOTE` finalize step and cleans up
  the partial note on cancel.
- **`wait_for_sources`** cancels sibling pollers on the first poller's
  failure rather than letting them race to emit error messages.
- **`wait_for_completion`** uses a leader/follower polling-dedupe registry
  with a shielded leader task — follower cancellation does not kill the
  leader's poll.

**Idempotent file uploads.** `SourcesAPI.add_file` closes its file handle
under a TOCTOU-safe path and gates concurrent uploads via the
`max_concurrent_uploads` semaphore so a large fan-out can't exhaust the
per-process file descriptor limit.

### Non-guarantees

**NOT thread-safe.** A `NotebookLMClient` instance must not be shared
across OS threads. The internal locks (`_refresh_lock`, `_reqid_lock`,
`_auth_snapshot_lock`) are `asyncio.Lock` instances and do not protect
against concurrent OS-thread access. If you need a client per thread,
construct one per thread.

**NOT reusable across event loops.** Per the loop-affinity guard above,
the hot path raises `RuntimeError` when an instance is re-used on a
different loop. Cold paths (`next_reqid()`, `close()`) raise an opaque
asyncio `RuntimeError` instead — same outcome, less helpful message.

**`ChatAPI._cache` is per-instance.** Chat-conversation IDs cached
inside a `NotebookLMClient` (on the `client.chat` sub-client) are not
shared across clients in the same process and never persisted across
processes. Two clients pointed at the same notebook will not share
follow-up context.

**Cookies in storage are eventually-consistent across processes.** When
multiple processes share a storage path, an OS-level file lock plus a
snapshot/delta merge (see `docs/auth-cookie-lifecycle.md` Appendix A2) keep concurrent
writers from corrupting the file. They may, however, observe brief
staleness — a write committed by process A may not be visible to a
sibling read in process B until the next refresh cycle. Within a single
process, in-process dedupe ensures only one keepalive task runs per
canonicalized storage path.

### Production patterns

**One client per app, dependency-injected.** A `NotebookLMClient` is
designed to be a long-lived process resource. In FastAPI, attach it to
the app lifespan:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, Request
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
        app.state.notebooklm = client
        yield
    # client.close() happens via __aexit__

def get_client(request: Request) -> NotebookLMClient:
    return request.app.state.notebooklm

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

@app.get("/notebooks")
async def list_notebooks(client: NotebookLMClient = Depends(get_client)):
    return await client.notebooks.list()
```

Constraint: FastAPI runs on a single event loop per worker, so one client
per worker is correct. If you run multiple Uvicorn workers, each worker
owns its own client. **Do not** stash a `NotebookLMClient` on a
process-global outside the lifespan — multi-worker servers fork the
process and you will end up with the same client object referencing
different event loops.

**`ConnectionLimits` tuning**. The HTTP pool defaults
(`max_connections=100`, `max_keepalive_connections=50`,
`keepalive_expiry=30.0`) are sized for typical batchexecute fan-out: a
few dozen concurrent RPCs against a single host with keep-alives held
for an interactive session. Tune via `notebooklm.types.ConnectionLimits`:

```python
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient
from notebooklm.types import ConnectionLimits

limits = ConnectionLimits(
    max_connections=200,         # widen the pool for a heavy worker
    max_keepalive_connections=100,
    keepalive_expiry=60.0,
)
client = NotebookLMClient(auth, limits=limits, max_concurrent_rpcs=64)
```

For single-request CLI workloads the defaults are wasteful but harmless.

**`max_concurrent_rpcs` knob**. A semaphore at
`_perform_authed_post` caps simultaneous in-flight RPC POSTs. Default
`16` — well below the default pool size so short-lived helper requests
(refresh GETs, upload preflights) still have pool headroom. Pass `None`
to opt out entirely (e.g. when an external rate-limiter handles
back-pressure). The backoff for 429 / 5xx retries is held **inside** the
semaphore for a circuit-breaker effect: a slow request keeps its slot
while it waits, so the gate naturally throttles fan-out when the server
is unhappy.

Worst-case slot hold time:

| Path | Bound | Default |
|---|---|---|
| 429 retry loop | `rate_limit_max_retries × MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS` | 3 × 300 = 900s |
| 5xx / network retry loop | `server_error_max_retries × 30s` (capped backoff) | 3 × 30 = 90s |

If your workload's tail latency is sensitive, lower
`rate_limit_max_retries` or tighten the semaphore — slot hold time on
the 429 path is the load-bearing variable.

**Constraint** (enforced at construction): `max_concurrent_rpcs ≤
ConnectionLimits.max_connections`. A higher RPC ceiling than the pool
capacity would let the semaphore admit requests the pool can't fulfill,
producing opaque `httpx.PoolTimeout` errors instead of clean
back-pressure. The `NotebookLMClient.__init__` / `from_storage()`
constructor raises `ValueError` if this constraint is violated. The
semaphore floor (`max_concurrent_rpcs ≥ 1` when not `None`) is enforced
by the same constructor path.

**`max_concurrent_uploads` knob**. Default `4`. Gates
file-upload streaming independently from the RPC throttle because
uploads use their own `httpx.AsyncClient` (Scotty endpoint) and do not
share the RPC connection pool. The motivation is FD exhaustion: each
in-flight upload holds one open file descriptor for the duration of the
upload, so an unbounded fan-out blows the per-process FD limit. `None`
resolves to the default (4); truly unbounded uploads are intentionally
not supported. Must be `≥ 1` when set explicitly.

**Rate-limit retry defaults**. `rate_limit_max_retries=3`,
`server_error_max_retries=3`. The 429 path honors the `Retry-After`
header when parseable (clamped at `MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECONDS = 300s`);
when the header is absent or unparseable, the loop falls back to
exponential backoff `min(2^attempt, 30)` seconds with ±20% jitter
(where `attempt` starts at `0`, so the first retry sleeps ~1 s ± 20%
before doubling), matching the 5xx path. Set either to `0` to restore
the pre-retry-loop behavior of raising `RateLimitError` / `ServerError`
immediately.

**Observability hooks.** The client exposes stdlib-only observability so
applications can choose their own metrics backend:

```python
from notebooklm import NotebookLMClient, correlation_id

events = []

async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(on_rpc_event=events.append) as client:
    with correlation_id("batch-import-42"):
        await client.notebooks.list()

    snapshot = client.metrics_snapshot()
    print(snapshot.rpc_calls_succeeded, snapshot.rpc_queue_wait_seconds_max)
```

`on_rpc_event` receives a `RpcTelemetryEvent` for each logical RPC
completion. `metrics_snapshot()` returns cumulative counters for RPC
success/failure, retry counts, semaphore queue waits, upload queue waits,
and internal lock wait time. The package does not depend on Prometheus or
OpenTelemetry; forward these values to whichever backend your service uses.

**Graceful shutdown.** Long-lived services can stop admitting new client
operations and wait for in-flight operations before closing:

```python
await client.close(drain=True, drain_timeout=30.0)
```

`client.drain(timeout=...)` is also available when your framework owns
transport shutdown separately. Once drain starts, new operations raise
`RuntimeError`; if the timeout expires, the client remains in draining mode.
`close(drain=True, ...)` still closes the transport after a drain timeout and
then re-raises the timeout.

**Upload-timeout configuration**. `client.sources.add_file(...)`
and the related upload entry points accept an `upload_timeout` argument
that is decoupled from the global `timeout`. A long-running upload of
a large file should not have to widen the global HTTP timeout to
succeed; pass `upload_timeout=600.0` (or larger) to the relevant call
sites instead.

**Per-RPC read windows compose with `timeout=`.** Chat (`chat_timeout=`,
built-in 180 s) and IMPORT_RESEARCH (`import_research_timeout=`, built-in
batch-scaled 60 s + 3 s/source capped at 240 s) carry longer read windows than
the shared 30 s one. Those built-ins are defaults, not caps: they only lengthen
the configured `timeout=`, so `NotebookLMClient(auth, timeout=600)` gets 600 s
on chat and IMPORT_RESEARCH too. Both kwargs read identically — left unset the
built-in composes, a number wins outright (including a *shorter* one, for
deliberately fast failure), and `None` inherits `timeout=` verbatim. A
non-positive or non-finite value raises at construction. Full table:
[configuration.md](configuration.md#how-the-per-rpc-windows-compose-with-timeout).

### Single-process multi-tenant guidance

For a service that handles multiple NotebookLM tenants (different
`AuthTokens`, typically one per user), spin up **one
`NotebookLMClient` per tenant**. There is no cross-tenant
`ChatAPI._cache` bleed (the cache is per-instance), and the
loop-affinity guard plus the per-instance refresh state means tenants
cannot accidentally observe each other's auth.

Cookie storage paths must be canonicalized so two clients pointing at
the same logical storage file don't run racing keepalive loops; the
keepalive code path handles this automatically.

### Constraints enforced at construction

These validations run in `NotebookLMClient.__init__` /
`NotebookLMClient.from_storage()`. All raise `ValueError`:

- `max_concurrent_rpcs ≤ ConnectionLimits.max_connections` when both are
  set (skipped when either is `None`).
- `max_concurrent_rpcs ≥ 1` when not `None`.
- `max_concurrent_uploads ≥ 1` when not `None`.
- `rate_limit_max_retries ≥ 0`.
- `server_error_max_retries ≥ 0`.
- `keepalive` must be `None` or a positive finite number; values below
  `keepalive_min_interval` (default `60s`) are clamped up to that floor.

## Internal module map

Kernel owns the `httpx.AsyncClient`; `NotebookLMClient` constructs the
runtime graph and owns the public surface. Per the
[ADR-0010](adr/0010-session-kernel-split.md) split, `Kernel.__init__` in
`src/notebooklm/_kernel.py` constructs the `httpx.AsyncClient` and is
responsible for closing it on `aclose()`. `_runtime/init.py` constructs
the collaborator bundle, `RuntimeTransport`, middleware chain, and
`RpcExecutor`, then binds them into `ClientComposed`. The supporting state
(metrics, drain bookkeeping, request-id counter, transport plumbing,
conversation cache, etc.) is split across single-responsibility runtime
and kernel collaborator modules such as `notebooklm._rpc_executor`,
`notebooklm._transport_drain`, and `notebooklm._transport_errors`. The
split is internal — module-level constants and helpers live in canonical
seam modules (`_runtime/config.py`, `_runtime/helpers.py`, `_error_injection`,
`_request_types`, `_transport_errors`, `_streaming_post`) and are imported
from those modules directly. The historical `notebooklm._core`
compatibility shim was removed in v0.5.0.

| Module | Owns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `_client_composed` | `ClientComposed`: bound runtime holder for transport, executor, middleware chain metadata, and the collaborator bundle. | The composition root binds this once; public methods read the bound collaborators from the client. |
| `_kernel` | Concrete `Kernel` transport core; owns the `httpx.AsyncClient` (constructed in `Kernel.__init__`, closed in `Kernel.aclose()`) and the cookie jar. | Pure transport surface (see `Kernel` Protocol in `_runtime/contracts.py`). |
| `_runtime/init.py` | Client composition root helpers: constructor validation, collaborator construction, `RuntimeTransport`, middleware chain, and `RpcExecutor` wiring. | `NotebookLMClient` calls this during construction and stores the result directly. |
| `_runtime/transport.py` | Authenticated transport leg used by `RpcExecutor` and the middleware chain terminal. | Routes through `Kernel.post` and centralizes request-envelope materialization. |
| `_runtime/config.py` | Module-level constants: `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`, `DEFAULT_CHAT_TIMEOUT`, `DEFAULT_IMPORT_RESEARCH_BASE_TIMEOUT`/`_PER_SOURCE_TIMEOUT`/`_MAX_TIMEOUT`, `DEFAULT_KEEPALIVE_MIN_INTERVAL`, `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_RPCS`, `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS`, `CORE_LOGGER_NAME`, `normalize_max_concurrent_uploads`. | Pure constants; importable without side effects. |
| `_runtime/helpers.py` | `is_auth_error`, `AUTH_ERROR_PATTERNS`, `_resolve_keepalive_interval`. | Cross-seam pure helpers; behaviour-bearing (and therefore unit-tested). |
| `_error_injection` | `ERROR_INJECT_ENV_VAR`, `_get_error_injection_mode`, `_refuse_synthetic_error_outside_test_context`. | Env-var resolver + startup guard for the synthetic-error harness. |
| `_runtime/auth.py` | `AuthRefreshCoordinator`: refresh-task lifecycle, refresh lock, `AuthSnapshot` rotation. | Lazy `asyncio.Lock` construction; never instantiated outside a running loop. |
| `_conversation_cache` | Per-instance true-LRU `_conversation_cache` for `ChatAPI` continuity; bounds the conversation count and the turns retained per conversation. | Pure in-process state; not shared across client instances. |
| `_cookie_persistence` | Cookie-jar → storage-state serialization, `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation. | Exposes a `SaveCookiesToStorage` Protocol host. |
| `_transport_drain` | `TransportDrainTracker`: in-flight transport counters, `_TransportOperationToken`, lazy `asyncio.Condition` powering `client.drain(...)`. | Construction is event-loop-agnostic; the `Condition` is allocated on first use. |
| `_runtime/lifecycle.py` | `ClientLifecycle`: loop-affinity guard, `aclose` plumbing, keepalive task wiring. | Client lifecycle collaborator. |
| `_client_metrics` | `ClientMetrics`: `ClientMetricsSnapshot` counters, `_metrics_lock`, `on_rpc_event` callback, queue-wait recorders. | `__init__` is event-loop-agnostic; `emit_rpc_event` is `async` and intentionally awaits the user callback (back-pressure). |
| `_polling_registry` | Pending-poll registry shared by long-running artifact generations. | Used by artifacts to coordinate and cancel pending polls. |
| `_reqid_counter` | `ReqidCounter`: monotonic `_reqid` for the chat backend, lazy `asyncio.Lock` for concurrent `ChatAPI.ask` callers. | Baseline `_value=100000`, default `step=100000` — both are chat-API contract values; do not change. |
| `_rpc_executor` | RPC dispatch executor; exposes `DecodeResponse` Protocol so callers can be unit-tested against a stub. | `NotebookLMClient.rpc_call` dispatches here directly. |
| `_request_types` | `AuthSnapshot`, `BuildRequest`, `BuildRequestResult`, and request materialization helpers. | Shared request Interface for RPC, chat, auth refresh, and the chain terminal. |
| `_transport_errors` | Transport exceptions, `Retry-After` parsing, and raw `Kernel.post` error mapping. | Keeps terminal error mapping out of `Kernel` callers and lets the middleware chain consume a narrow exception Interface. |
| `_streaming_post` | Streaming POST helper with the response-size cap. | Keeps low-level buffered HTTP read behavior local to the `Kernel.post` implementation. |

Feature APIs depend on narrow per-capability Protocols defined in
`notebooklm._runtime.contracts` rather than on a broad runtime facade.
`ChatAPI`, `ArtifactsAPI`, and `SourceUploadPipeline` each take
their direct collaborators by keyword-only constructor argument. The
feature-local composite-runtime Protocols (`ChatRuntime`,
`ArtifactsRuntime`, `UploadRuntime`) and their adapter dataclasses that
previously bundled three collaborators apiece were retired once it was
clear they only hid three stable collaborators with one production
satisfier.
See [ADR-0013](adr/0013-composable-session-capabilities.md) and
[`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) for the rationale and the
post-v0.5.0 collaborator graph.

If you previously imported from `notebooklm._core` modules, see
[`docs/refactor-history.md`](refactor-history.md) for the
Tier 12 → Tier 13 rename table. The `notebooklm._core` compatibility
shim was removed in v0.5.0; first-party callers should import directly
from the canonical seam modules (`_runtime/config.py`, `_runtime/helpers.py`,
`_request_types`, `_transport_errors`, `_streaming_post`, `_error_injection`,
`_transport_drain`, etc.).

        raise_on_null_status: bool = False,

```

`RPCMethod` is imported from `notebooklm.rpc` for raw-RPC calls; `Any` is
`typing.Any`. The default-shape call (`client.rpc_call(method, params)`)
forwards to the underlying `RpcExecutor.rpc_call` with its canonical
defaults. `read_timeout` (added in #2187) overrides the client-wide read
timeout for this one call — internal callers use it for RPCs known to run
long (e.g. `ResearchAPI.import_sources`'s batch-scaled IMPORT_RESEARCH
timeout); `None` (the default) inherits the client's configured `timeout`.
`raise_on_null_status` (added in #2188) pairs with `allow_null=True`: a null
result the server tagged with a recognized non-OK `google.rpc.Status` raises
with that status instead of decoding to `None`, so a rejection is reported
with the server's own code rather than a client-invented reason. It is opt-in
because several RPCs are recorded answering a status on flows this client
treats as successful — see
[rpc-reference.md](rpc-reference.md#rejection-frames-googlerpcstatus-at-wrbfr-index-5).

**Cookie persistence override:** `cookie_saver=None` (the default) uses the
canonical typed `ProfileStore` merge for close, refresh, and keepalive saves.
Supplying `cookie_saver=` retains the v0.x callback compatibility seam; the
callback receives a defensive copy and runs in a worker thread. It is invoked
as `saver(jar, path, original_snapshot=..., return_result=True)` and may return
`bool` or `CookieSaveResult`. Rebinding
`notebooklm._auth.storage.save_cookies_to_storage` does not change a live
client's normal persistence route.

> **Removed in v0.6.0.** The three previously-deprecated kwargs

**Long-lived clients:** pass `keepalive=<seconds>` to spawn a background task
that periodically pokes `accounts.google.com` and persists any rotated
`__Secure-1PSIDTS` cookie to `storage_state.json`. This keeps a worker /
agent / long-running `async with` block from silently staling out. Disabled
by default (`keepalive=None`). Values below `keepalive_min_interval` (default
`60.0`) are clamped up to that floor. See [Cookie freshness for long-running
/ unattended use](troubleshooting.md#cookie-freshness-for-long-running--unattended-use)
for the full layered story.

**Retry behavior:** the client retries transient failures transparently.

- `server_error_max_retries` (default `3`) retries HTTP 5xx and network-layer
  `httpx.RequestError` (timeouts, connect errors) with exponential backoff
  capped at 30 seconds (`min(2 ** attempt, 30)`, plus ±20% jitter to
  desynchronize concurrent retries). Set to `0` to disable.
- `rate_limit_max_retries` (default `3`) retries HTTP 429 responses.
  Each retry sleeps for the server's `Retry-After` value when parseable;
  otherwise the loop falls back to the same capped-exponential-backoff
  schedule used for 5xx (`min(2 ** attempt, 30)` seconds with ±20%
  jitter) so the positive default is still useful when Google omits the
  hint. Set to `0` to raise `RateLimitError` immediately (e.g. when the
  calling code implements its own bespoke back-off policy). Mutating
  create RPCs (`notebooks.create`, `sources.add_url`) opt out of this
  loop via `disable_internal_retries` so the API-layer
  `idempotent_create` probe-then-retry wrapper can own recovery for
  mutating calls.
- `limits` accepts a `ConnectionLimits` dataclass to tune the underlying
  `httpx` connection pool. The default (`ConnectionLimits()`) sets
  `max_connections=100`, `max_keepalive_connections=50`,
  `keepalive_expiry=30.0` — sized for typical batchexecute fan-out. Widen
  for heavy concurrent workloads such as FastAPI/Django services that share
  one client across many requests.

```python
from notebooklm import ConnectionLimits, NotebookLMClient

# Default ``rate_limit_max_retries=3`` is on; widen the pool for a heavy worker
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(
    limits=ConnectionLimits(max_connections=200, max_keepalive_connections=100),
) as client:
    ...

# Opt out of automatic 429 retries (e.g. for a bespoke back-off layer)
async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage(rate_limit_max_retries=0) as client:
    ...
```

> **v0.7.0 breaking change — `delete()` / `rename()` returns (issues #1211, #1255).**
> Applies to `notebooks`, `sources`, `artifacts`, `notes`, and `mind_maps`:
>
> - **`delete()` returns `None`** (was a hardcoded `True`). `True → None` flips
>   truthy → falsy, so `if await client.X.delete(id): ...` **no longer enters
>   its block** — drop the `if` and call `delete()` for its effect. `delete()`
>   is **idempotent**: deleting an already-absent target succeeds (returns
>   `None`) and does not raise `*NotFoundError`; real failures
>   (`403`/`5xx`/auth/transport) still raise. Use `get()` first to assert
>   existence.
> - **`rename()` returns the renamed object** and raises `*NotFoundError`
>   (`MindMapNotFoundError` for mind maps) on a missing target. Pass
>   **`return_object=False`** to skip the hydrate re-fetch and return `None`.
>   For `notebooks`/`sources`/`artifacts`, missing-target detection rides on
>   that hydrate re-fetch, so `return_object=False` also skips it (a missing
>   target does not raise under the opt-out). **Mind maps are the exception:**
>   they detect absence via a content/list lookup *before* dispatching the
>   rename RPC (never a transport 404), so `mind_maps.rename` raises
>   `MindMapNotFoundError` on a missing target **even with**

### NotebooksAPI (`client.notebooks`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Notebook Commands](cli-reference.md#notebook-commands) — `notebooklm list`, `create`, `delete`, `rename`, `summary`.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `list()` | - | `list[Notebook]` | List all notebooks |
| `create(title)` | `title: str` | `Notebook` | Create a notebook |
| `get(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `Notebook` | Get notebook details |
| `delete(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `None` | Delete a notebook (idempotent; returns `None` whether or not it existed) |
| `rename(notebook_id, new_title)` | `notebook_id: str, new_title: str` | `Notebook` | Rename a notebook (re-fetched; raises `NotebookNotFoundError` if missing) |
| `set_emoji(notebook_id, emoji)` | `notebook_id: str, emoji: str` | `Notebook` | Set (or clear with `""`) the notebook display emoji and re-fetch it |
| `update(notebook_id, *, title=None, emoji=None)` | `str, str \| None, str \| None` | `Notebook` | Set title and/or emoji in one `MutateProject`; raises `ValidationError` when both are `None` |
| `get_description(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `NotebookDescription` | Get AI summary and topics |
| `suggest_prompts(notebook_id, *, source_ids=None, mode=4, query=None)` | `str, list[str] \| None, int, str \| None` | `list[PromptSuggestion]` | Get AI-suggested prompts for the notebook. `source_ids=None` uses all sources; `mode` is the required `1..10` "mode/surface" int (default `4` suggests chat questions; other modes target other surfaces); `query` optionally steers the suggestions. Each `PromptSuggestion.prompt` is a ready-to-send instruction for `ask()`. |
| `get_metadata(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `NotebookMetadata` | Get notebook metadata and sources |
| `get_summary(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `str` | Get raw summary text |
| `get_share_url(notebook_id, artifact_id=None)` | `notebook_id: str, str \| None` | `str` | Get a share URL |
| `remove_from_recent(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `None` | Remove from recently viewed |
| `get_raw(notebook_id)` | `notebook_id: str` | `Any` | Get raw API response data |

**Example:**
```python
# List all notebooks
notebooks = await client.notebooks.list()
for nb in notebooks:
    print(f"{nb.id}: {nb.title} ({nb.sources_count} sources)")

# Create and rename
nb = await client.notebooks.create("Draft")
nb = await client.notebooks.update(nb.id, title="Final Version", emoji="📖")

# Get AI-generated description (parsed with suggested topics)
desc = await client.notebooks.get_description(nb.id)
print(desc.summary)
for topic in desc.suggested_topics:
    print(f"  - {topic.question}")

# Get raw summary text (unparsed)
summary = await client.notebooks.get_summary(nb.id)
print(summary)

# Get metadata for automation or exports
metadata = await client.notebooks.get_metadata(nb.id)
print(metadata.title)

# Enable public sharing and fetch the URL
await client.sharing.set_public(nb.id, public=True)
url = client.notebooks.get_share_url(nb.id)  # sync — formats the URL, no RPC
print(url)
```

**get_summary vs get_description:**
- `get_summary()` returns the raw summary text string
- `get_description()` returns a `NotebookDescription` object with the parsed summary and a list of `SuggestedTopic` objects for suggested questions

### SourcesAPI (`client.sources`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Source Commands](cli-reference.md#source-commands-notebooklm-source-cmd) — `notebooklm source add`, `list`, `get`, `fulltext`, `guide`, `rename`, `refresh`, `delete`, `wait`.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `list(notebook_id, *, strict=False, statuses=None, types=None)` | `str, *, bool, Collection[SourceStatus] \| None, Collection[SourceType] \| None` | `list[Source]` | List sources, optionally filtered after normalization |
| `get(notebook_id, source_id)` | `str, str` | `Source` | Get source details; raises `SourceNotFoundError` on a miss |
| `get_or_none(notebook_id, source_id)` | `str, str` | `Source \| None` | Optional lookup; returns `None` when absent |
| `get_fulltext(notebook_id, source_id, *, output_format="text")` | `str, str, *, output_format: Literal["text", "markdown"]` | `SourceFulltext` | Get full content; `"markdown"` requires the optional `markdownify` extra |
| `get_guide(notebook_id, source_id)` | `str, str` | `SourceGuide` | Get AI-generated `summary` + `keywords`; use attribute access (`guide.summary`) |
| `add_url(notebook_id, url, *, wait=False, wait_timeout=120.0)` | `str, str, *, bool, float` | `Source` | Add URL source (autodetects YouTube URLs and routes them appropriately). `wait` / `wait_timeout` are keyword-only (the positional-wait shim was removed in v0.7.0). |
| `add_text(notebook_id, title, content, *, wait=False, wait_timeout=120.0, idempotent=False)` | `str, str, str, *, bool, float, bool` | `Source` | Add text content. `wait` / `wait_timeout` are keyword-only (the positional-wait shim was removed in v0.7.0). |
| `add_file(notebook_id, file_path, mime_type=None, *, wait=False, wait_timeout=120.0, title=None, on_progress=None)` | `str, str \| Path, str \| None, *, bool, float, str \| None, Callable \| None` | `Source` | Upload file. `mime_type` is a **supported** parameter — it overrides filename-extension inference to set the resumable-upload content-type header (omit it to infer from the extension). `wait` / `wait_timeout` are keyword-only (the positional-wait shim was removed in v0.7.0). `title` sets the display name via a post-upload `UPDATE_SOURCE` and forces a brief registration wait even when `wait=False`. `on_progress(bytes_sent, total_bytes)` may be sync or async. |
| `add_drive(notebook_id, file_id, title, mime_type="application/vnd.google-apps.document", *, wait=False, wait_timeout=120.0)` | `str, str, str, str, *, bool, float` | `Source` | Add Google Drive doc. `mime_type` defaults to Google Docs; override for Slides/Sheets/PDF via `DriveMimeType` (see `notebooklm.types`). `wait` / `wait_timeout` are keyword-only (the positional-wait shim was removed in v0.7.0). NotebookLM's backend re-derives the display title from live Drive metadata for native Drive imports, discarding the requested `title`; the method now issues an automatic best-effort follow-up `rename()` so an explicit `title` still wins (non-fatal — a rename failure logs a warning and keeps the added source under its upstream title; issue #1960). |
| `rename(notebook_id, source_id, new_title, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, str` | `Source \| None` | Rename source (prefers the `UPDATE_SOURCE` echo, else re-fetched; raises `SourceNotFoundError` if missing). `return_object=False` returns `None` without hydrating. |
| `refresh(notebook_id, source_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | Refresh URL/Drive source |
| `check_freshness(notebook_id, source_id)` | `str, str` | `bool` | Check if source needs refresh |
| `delete(notebook_id, source_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | Delete source (idempotent; returns `None` whether or not it existed) |
| `wait_until_ready(notebook_id, source_id, timeout=120.0, ...)` | `str, str, float, ...` | `Source` | Poll until `status == READY` (fully processed). Raises `SourceTimeoutError`/`SourceProcessingError`/`SourceNotFoundError` — see [Processing failures vs. timeouts](#processing-failures-vs-timeouts). |
| `wait_until_registered(notebook_id, source_id, timeout=30.0, ...)` | `str, str, float, ...` | `Source` | Poll until the source is visible server-side (any non-ERROR status). Completes quickly (seconds for typical sources); intended for narrow follow-up RPCs (e.g. `UPDATE_SOURCE`) that only require registration, not full processing. |
| `wait_for_sources(notebook_id, source_ids, timeout=120.0, **kwargs)` | `str, list[str], float, ...` | `list[Source]` | Wait for multiple sources to become ready **in parallel**. Per-source timeout; `**kwargs` are forwarded to `wait_until_ready`. |
| `wait_all_until_ready(notebook_id, source_ids, timeout=120.0, initial_interval=1.0, max_interval=10.0, backoff_factor=1.5, transient_error_types=None)` | `str, list[str], float, ...` | `list[SourceWaitResult]` | Wait for many sources with **one notebook snapshot per poll tick** (cheaper than `wait_for_sources`'s per-source polling for large batches). Terminal per-source failures (`SourceNotFoundError` / `SourceProcessingError` / `SourceTimeoutError`) are **returned**, not raised — one result per id, in input order. |

**Example:**
```python
from pathlib import Path

# Add various source types
await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, "https://example.com/article")
await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...")  # YouTube URLs autodetected
await client.sources.add_text(nb_id, "My Notes", "Content here...")
await client.sources.add_file(nb_id, Path("./document.pdf"))

# Upload a file with a custom display title (rename happens after upload via
# UPDATE_SOURCE — a brief registration wait runs even when wait=False so the
# rename can land). The mime_type kwarg is optional: omit it to infer the
# content-type from the filename extension, or pass it to override inference.
await client.sources.add_file(nb_id, Path("./document.pdf"), title="Q4 Strategy Memo")

# Wait for several uploads to finish processing in parallel
ids = [
    (await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, "https://example.com/a")).id,
    (await client.sources.add_url(nb_id, "https://example.com/b")).id,
]
ready = await client.sources.wait_for_sources(nb_id, ids, timeout=180)

# Narrow wait: only block until the source is visible server-side (not fully
# processed). Use this before follow-up RPCs like UPDATE_SOURCE.
registered = await client.sources.wait_until_registered(nb_id, ids[0])

# List and manage
sources = await client.sources.list(nb_id)
for src in sources:
    print(f"{src.id}: {src.title} ({src.kind})")

# Filters are ORed within an axis and ANDed across axes. Backend order is
# preserved; an explicitly empty filter matches no sources.
from notebooklm import SourceStatus, SourceType

ready_documents = await client.sources.list(
    nb_id,
    statuses={SourceStatus.READY},
    types={SourceType.PDF, SourceType.DOCX, SourceType.GOOGLE_DOCS},
)

# The backend does not expose a separate authoritative count endpoint. For an
# exact count of uniquely addressable sources, request a strict normalized
# snapshot and count it locally.
actual_source_count = len(await client.sources.list(nb_id, strict=True))

await client.sources.rename(nb_id, src.id, "Better Title")
await client.sources.refresh(nb_id, src.id)  # Re-fetch URL content

# Check if a source needs refreshing (content changed)
is_fresh = await client.sources.check_freshness(nb_id, src.id)
if not is_fresh:
    await client.sources.refresh(nb_id, src.id)

# Get full indexed content (what NotebookLM uses for answers)
fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(nb_id, src.id)
print(f"Content ({fulltext.char_count} chars): {fulltext.content[:500]}...")

# Get AI-generated summary and keywords (returns a typed SourceGuide)
guide = await client.sources.get_guide(nb_id, src.id)
print(f"Summary: {guide.summary}")
print(f"Keywords: {guide.keywords}")
# SourceGuide is a typed value; prefer attribute access.
```

`sources.list()` performs one `GET_NOTEBOOK` read. `statuses` and `types` do
not trigger extra RPCs: each collection is snapshotted before the read, then
matched against normalized `Source.status` and `Source.kind` values. Multiple
members within `statuses` or `types` are alternatives (OR); supplying both
axes requires both to match (AND). `None` means no filter on that axis, while
an explicitly empty collection matches nothing.

The `strict` option is for callers that need a trustworthy count. Response-
envelope drift always raises `RPCError`, regardless of this option. At the row
level, the default `strict=False` keeps backward-compatible recovery: malformed
or id-less rows are skipped and duplicate IDs keep their first normalized
value. `strict=True` instead raises on malformed/id-less rows, on ID-bearing
rows whose type or status discriminant is missing/malformed, and on duplicate
IDs whose normalized values conflict. Duplicate rows that normalize to the
same `Source` still collapse to one resource because the count is of unique,
addressable sources—not raw wire rows. Therefore the canonical exact-count
operation is:

```python
actual_count = len(await client.sources.list(notebook_id, strict=True))
```

Apply `statuses=` / `types=` to that same call when the desired count is for a
filtered subset. There is intentionally no separate `sources.count()` or
inventory object: the backend already returns the source rows needed to count,
so another public surface would imply authority or efficiency that does not
exist.

### ArtifactsAPI (`client.artifacts`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Artifact Commands](cli-reference.md#artifact-commands-notebooklm-artifact-cmd) — `notebooklm artifact list`, `get`, `rename`, `delete`, `export`, `poll`, `wait`. Generation methods map to [Generate Commands](cli-reference.md#generate-commands-notebooklm-generate-type) (`notebooklm generate <type>`); download methods map to [Download Commands](cli-reference.md#download-commands-notebooklm-download-type) (`notebooklm download <type>`).

#### Core Methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `list(notebook_id, artifact_type=None)` | `str, ArtifactType \| None` | `list[Artifact]` | List artifacts |
| `get(notebook_id, artifact_id)` | `str, str` | `Artifact` | Get artifact details; raises `ArtifactNotFoundError` on a miss |
| `get_or_none(notebook_id, artifact_id)` | `str, str` | `Artifact \| None` | Optional lookup; returns `None` when absent |
| `get_prompt(notebook_id, artifact_id)` | `str, str` | `str \| None` | Get the free-text prompt the artifact was generated from (any studio type). Returns `None` if the artifact has no stored prompt (e.g. a note-backed mind map); raises `ArtifactNotFoundError` for an unknown id |
| `delete(notebook_id, artifact_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | Delete artifact (idempotent; returns `None` whether or not it existed) |
| `rename(notebook_id, artifact_id, new_title, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, str` | `Artifact \| None` | Rename artifact (re-fetched; raises `ArtifactNotFoundError` if missing). `return_object=False` skips the re-fetch and returns `None`. |
| `poll_status(notebook_id, task_id)` | `str, str` | `GenerationStatus` | Check generation status |
| `wait_for_completion(notebook_id, task_id, ...)` | `str, str, ...` | `GenerationStatus` | Wait for generation. Pass `on_status_change(status)` for sync or async progress callbacks. |
| `retry_failed(notebook_id, artifact_id)` | `str, str` | `GenerationStatus` | Retry a failed Studio artifact in place (the UI "Retry"). Same `artifact_id` preserved; accepted → `status="pending"` (re-queued; advances to `in_progress` on a later poll); a synchronous refusal (rate limit / quota / not-retryable) **raises** `RateLimitError`/`RPCError`. See below. |

#### Retrying a Failed Artifact

**CLI equivalent:** `notebooklm artifact retry <artifact_id> -n <notebook_id> [--json] [--wait]`.

`retry_failed(notebook_id, artifact_id)` re-runs generation for an
already-failed artifact **in place** — the UI "Retry" action. The artifact is
not deleted first; the same `artifact_id` is preserved and returned as the task
id, so `poll_status()` / `wait_for_completion()` keep working against it.

It follows the ADR-0019 "async kickoff" contract: an accepted retry returns
`GenerationStatus(status="pending")` — the response row carries wire code 1
(`ARTIFACT_STATUS_INITIALIZED`), i.e. re-queued but not yet picked up, advancing
to `in_progress` on a later poll — while a **synchronous refusal**
(`USER_DISPLAYABLE_ERROR` — rate limit, quota, or a non-retryable artifact)
**raises** the underlying `RateLimitError` / `RPCError` rather than returning a
`status="failed"` handle. (As a brand-new method it is born on the right side
of the contract; the `generate_*` / `revise_slide` methods still swallow such
refusals into `status="failed"` until v0.8.0.) A retry can itself fail again
provider-side — observed by later polling as a terminal `failed` status — so
callers decide whether to re-invoke.

```python
status = await client.artifacts.retry_failed(nb_id, failed_artifact_id)
# status.task_id == failed_artifact_id, status.status == "pending"
final = await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(nb_id, status.task_id)

# Auto-retry on a rate-limited refusal with the public helper. Because
# retry_failed RAISES RateLimitError (rather than returning a rate-limited
# status), with_rate_limit_retry now also catches that exception, backs off,
# and re-raises if the budget is exhausted.
from notebooklm.artifacts import with_rate_limit_retry

status = await with_rate_limit_retry(
    lambda: client.artifacts.retry_failed(nb_id, failed_artifact_id),
    max_retries=3,
)

| `download_report(notebook_id, output_path, artifact_id=None)` | `str, str, str` | `str` | Download report as Markdown (.md) |
| `download_mind_map(notebook_id, output_path, artifact_id=None)` | `str, str, str` | `str` | Download mind map as JSON (.json) |
| `download_data_table(notebook_id, output_path, artifact_id=None)` | `str, str, str` | `str` | Download data table as CSV (.csv) |
| `download_quiz(notebook_id, output_path, artifact_id=None, output_format="json")` | `str, str, str, str` | `str` | Download quiz (json/markdown/html) |
| `download_flashcards(notebook_id, output_path, artifact_id=None, output_format="json")` | `str, str, str, str` | `str` | Download flashcards (json/markdown/html) |

**Download Methods:**

```python
# Download the most recent completed audio overview
path = await client.artifacts.download_audio(nb_id, "podcast.mp4")

# Download a specific audio artifact by ID
path = await client.artifacts.download_audio(nb_id, "podcast.mp4", artifact_id="abc123")

# Download video overview
path = await client.artifacts.download_video(nb_id, "video.mp4")

# Download infographic
path = await client.artifacts.download_infographic(nb_id, "infographic.png")

# Download slide deck as PDF
path = await client.artifacts.download_slide_deck(nb_id, "./slides.pdf")
# Returns: "./slides.pdf"

# Download report as Markdown
path = await client.artifacts.download_report(nb_id, "./study-guide.md")
# Extracts markdown content from Briefing Doc, Study Guide, Blog Post, etc.

# Download mind map as JSON
path = await client.artifacts.download_mind_map(nb_id, "./concept-map.json")
# JSON structure: {"name": "Topic", "children": [{"name": "Subtopic", ...}]}

# Download data table as CSV
path = await client.artifacts.download_data_table(nb_id, "./data.csv")
# CSV uses UTF-8 with BOM encoding for Excel compatibility

# Download quiz as JSON (default)
path = await client.artifacts.download_quiz(nb_id, "quiz.json")

# Download quiz as markdown with answers marked
path = await client.artifacts.download_quiz(nb_id, "quiz.md", output_format="markdown")

# Download flashcards as JSON (normalizes f/b to front/back)
path = await client.artifacts.download_flashcards(nb_id, "cards.json")

# Download flashcards as markdown
path = await client.artifacts.download_flashcards(nb_id, "cards.md", output_format="markdown")
```

**Notes:**
- If `artifact_id` is not specified, downloads the first completed artifact of that type
- Raises `ValueError` if no completed artifact is found
- Some URLs require browser-based download (handled automatically)
- Report downloads extract the markdown content from the artifact
- Mind map downloads return a JSON tree structure with `name` and `children` fields
- Data table downloads parse the complex rich-text format into CSV rows/columns
- Quiz/flashcard formats: `json` (structured), `markdown` (readable), `html` (raw)
- Downloads automatically use the storage path from `from_storage(path=...)` or the resolved profile for cookie authentication

#### Export Methods

Export artifacts to Google Docs or Google Sheets.

**CLI equivalent:** `notebooklm artifact export <id> --title TEXT --type [docs|sheets]` (see [Artifact Commands](cli-reference.md#artifact-commands-notebooklm-artifact-cmd)).

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `export_report(notebook_id, artifact_id, title="Export", export_type=ExportType.DOCS)` | `str, str, str, ExportType` | `Any` | Export report to Google Docs/Sheets |
| `export_data_table(notebook_id, artifact_id, title="Export")` | `str, str, str` | `Any` | Export data table to Google Sheets |
| `export(notebook_id, artifact_id=None, content=None, title="Export", export_type=ExportType.DOCS)` | `str, str \| None, str \| None, str, ExportType` | `Any` | Generic export to Docs/Sheets. All trailing parameters are optional with defaults; pass `content=...` to export inline content without a pre-existing artifact. |

**Export Types (ExportType enum):**
- `ExportType.DOCS` (1): Export to Google Docs
- `ExportType.SHEETS` (2): Export to Google Sheets

```python
from notebooklm import ExportType

# Export a report to Google Docs
result = await client.artifacts.export_report(
    nb_id,
    artifact_id="report_123",
    title="My Briefing Doc",
    export_type=ExportType.DOCS
)
# result contains the Google Docs URL

# Export a data table to Google Sheets
result = await client.artifacts.export_data_table(
    nb_id,
    artifact_id="table_456",
    title="Research Data"
)
# result contains the Google Sheets URL

# Generic export (e.g., export any artifact to Sheets). Signature:
# `export(notebook_id, artifact_id=None, title="Export",
# export_type=ExportType.DOCS, *, content=None)`. Exactly one of
# `artifact_id=` or `content=` must be supplied (both or neither raises
# `ValidationError`). `content` is keyword-only so the positional slots line
# up with `export_report` / `export_data_table` (`title` in slot 3); supply
# `content=...` to export inline text without a pre-existing artifact.
result = await client.artifacts.export(
    nb_id,
    artifact_id="artifact_789",
    title="Exported Content",
    export_type=ExportType.SHEETS
)
```

**Generation Methods:**

When `language` is omitted, artifact generation defaults to `"en"` (the
historical default). Pass `language=None` to read `NOTEBOOKLM_HL` and fall back
to `"en"` if unset, or pass a concrete code such as `language="ko"` to force
that language.

```python
from notebooklm import (
    AudioFormat,
    AudioLength,
    InfographicStyle,
    VideoFormat,
    VideoStyle,
    ReportFormat,
    QuizQuantity,
    QuizDifficulty,
)

# Audio (podcast)
status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(
    notebook_id,
    source_ids=None,           # List of source IDs (None = all)
    instructions="...",        # Custom instructions
    audio_format=AudioFormat.DEEP_DIVE,  # DEEP_DIVE, BRIEF, CRITIQUE, DEBATE
    audio_length=AudioLength.DEFAULT,    # SHORT, DEFAULT, LONG
    language="en"
)

# Video
status = await client.artifacts.generate_video(
    notebook_id,
    source_ids=None,
    instructions="...",
    video_format=VideoFormat.EXPLAINER,  # EXPLAINER, BRIEF, CINEMATIC, SHORT
    video_style=VideoStyle.AUTO_SELECT,  # AUTO_SELECT, CLASSIC, WHITEBOARD, KAWAII, ANIME, etc.
    language="en"
)

# Report
status = await client.artifacts.generate_report(
    notebook_id,
    report_format=ReportFormat.STUDY_GUIDE,  # BRIEFING_DOC, STUDY_GUIDE, BLOG_POST, CUSTOM
    source_ids=None,
    language="en",
    custom_prompt=None,          # Used with ReportFormat.CUSTOM
    extra_instructions="..."     # Optional append for built-in formats
)

# Quiz
status = await client.artifacts.generate_quiz(
    notebook_id,
    source_ids=None,
    instructions="...",
    quantity=QuizQuantity.MORE,        # FEWER, STANDARD, MORE
    difficulty=QuizDifficulty.MEDIUM,  # EASY, MEDIUM, HARD
)
```

**Omitting an option does not mean "let the server choose."** `quantity=None` /
`difficulty=None` (the defaults) are resolved to `QuizQuantity.STANDARD` and
`QuizDifficulty.MEDIUM` and sent **explicitly**, matching the web UI and every
other `generate_*` method here. The backend does accept an omitted option
message, but then stores nothing, so neither you nor this client can see what it
picked — the artifact echoes the pair back only when it was sent (#2196). Pass
the member you want if you need a specific setting.

Anything other than an enum member or `None` raises `ValidationError`, including
the *other* option enum: `quantity=QuizDifficulty.HARD` used to encode silently
as `MORE`, because both are `3`.

**Rate-limit retry for generation:**

```python
from notebooklm.artifacts import with_rate_limit_retry

status = await with_rate_limit_retry(
    lambda: client.artifacts.generate_audio(
        notebook_id,
        instructions="focus on the counterarguments",
    ),
    max_retries=3,
)
```

**Waiting for Completion:**

```python
from notebooklm import ArtifactTimeoutError

# Start generation
status = await client.artifacts.generate_audio(nb_id)

try:
    # Wait with polling. Use higher timeouts for media jobs:
    # audio=1200s, video=1800s, cinematic-video=3600s.
    final = await client.artifacts.wait_for_completion(
        nb_id,
        status.task_id,
        timeout=1200,     # Max wait time in seconds
        initial_interval=5  # Initial seconds between polls
    )
except ArtifactTimeoutError as exc:
    print(exc.stalled_phase, exc.last_status, exc.status_history)
    raise

if final.is_complete:
    path = await client.artifacts.download_audio(nb_id, "podcast.m4a")
    print(f"Saved to: {path}")
else:
    print(f"Failed or timed out: {final.status}")
```

### ChatAPI (`client.chat`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Chat Commands](cli-reference.md#chat-commands) — `notebooklm ask`, `configure`, `history`.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `ask(notebook_id, question, ...)` | `str, str, ...` | `AskResult` | Ask a question |
| `configure(notebook_id, ...)` | `str, ...` | `None` | Set chat persona. **Writes the whole chat-settings block with no merge** — an omitted `goal`/`response_length` resets that field to its default. For a partial, merge-preserving update use the CLI `configure` / MCP `chat_configure` (they read `get_settings` first). |
| `get_settings(notebook_id)` | `str` | `ChatSettings` | Read the notebook's current chat configuration (`goal`, `response_length`, `custom_prompt`). A never-configured notebook reads back as `DEFAULT`/`DEFAULT`. |
| `get_history(notebook_id, limit=100, conversation_id=None)` | `str, int, str` | `list[tuple[str, str]]` | Get Q&A pairs from most recent conversation |
| `get_conversation_id(notebook_id)` | `str` | `str \| None` | Get most recent conversation ID from server |
| `delete_conversation(notebook_id, conversation_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | **DESTRUCTIVE.** Permanently delete a server-side conversation (web UI's "Delete history" action). The next `ask()` with no `conversation_id` then starts a brand-new conversation. |
| `save_answer_as_note(notebook_id, ask_result, *, title=None)` | `str, AskResult, str \| None` | `Note` | Save a chat answer as a citation-rich note ([issue #660](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/660)) — the resulting note's `[N]` markers remain interactive hover-anchored citations in the NotebookLM web UI. Owns the saved-from-chat workflow on `ChatAPI` (the data owner). Raises `ValueError` if `ask_result.references` is empty. When `title is None`, derives `f"Chat: {ask_result.answer[:50].strip().replace(chr(10), ' ')}"`. |

**ask() Parameters:**
```python
async def ask(
    notebook_id: str,
    question: str,
    source_ids: list[str] | None = None,  # Limit to specific sources (None = all)
    conversation_id: str | None = None,   # Continue existing conversation
) -> AskResult:
```

**Conversation semantics (issue #659):**

- `conversation_id=None` matches the web UI's default: the server attaches the
  question to your current conversation on this notebook (or creates one if
  none exists). Repeated `ask()` calls without `conversation_id` extend the
  same conversation; they do not start fresh ones. The SDK resolves the
  server-recorded conversation id through `hPTbtc` when needed and surfaces it
  on `AskResult.conversation_id`, so passing it back as `conversation_id=` for
  follow-ups works. The first ask after `notebooks.create()` binds to the
  server-issued `ChatSession` id in the create response instead, avoiding that
  redundant lookup while keeping the POST target and returned id identical.
- `conversation_id=<existing-id>` is a follow-up: the question is appended
  to the named conversation.
- To force a brand-new conversation, call
  `client.chat.delete_conversation(notebook_id, last_conversation_id)`
  first — the server then has nothing to extend and the next null-conv
  `ask()` starts a fresh thread. **This is destructive: deleted turns
  are not recoverable.** The method mirrors the web UI's "Delete
  history" button (`J7Gthc` RPC) and is the same primitive the CLI's
  `notebooklm ask --new` is built on.

**Example:**
```python
from notebooklm import ChatGoal, ChatResponseLength

# Ask questions (uses all sources)
result = await client.chat.ask(nb_id, "What are the main themes?")
print(result.answer)
print(result.conversation_id)  # server-recorded id (CREATE hint or hPTbtc)

# Access source references (cited in answer as [1], [2], etc.)
for ref in result.references:
    print(f"Citation {ref.citation_number}: Source {ref.source_id}")

# Ask using only specific sources
result = await client.chat.ask(
    nb_id,
    "Summarize the key points",
    source_ids=["src_001", "src_002"]
)

# Continue conversation explicitly (or omit conversation_id — same effect
# while the most-recent conversation on the notebook stays unchanged).
result = await client.chat.ask(
    nb_id,
    "Can you elaborate on the first point?",
    conversation_id=result.conversation_id
)

# Force a fresh conversation (destructive — turns are not recoverable).
# Mirrors the web UI's "Delete history" button.
last_conv_id = await client.chat.get_conversation_id(nb_id)
if last_conv_id:
    await client.chat.delete_conversation(nb_id, last_conv_id)
result = await client.chat.ask(nb_id, "Start fresh — what are the themes?")
assert result.turn_number == 1

# Configure persona
await client.chat.configure(
    nb_id,
    goal=ChatGoal.LEARNING_GUIDE,
    response_length=ChatResponseLength.LONGER,
    custom_prompt="Focus on practical applications"
)

# Save a chat answer as a citation-rich note (preserves [N] hover links).
# This is the canonical owner of the saved-from-chat workflow — the data
# owner (`ChatAPI`) persists, so the answer text and references stay
# adjacent to the call that produced them.
result = await client.chat.ask(nb_id, "What fruits are mentioned?")
if result.references:
    note = await client.chat.save_answer_as_note(
        nb_id, result, title="Fruit Citations"
    )
    # The NotebookLM server may auto-generate a "smart" title for
    # citation-rich notes; note.title reflects what the server stored.
```

### ResearchAPI (`client.research`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Research Commands](cli-reference.md#research-commands-notebooklm-research-cmd) (`notebooklm research status`, `wait`, `import`, `cancel`) plus `notebooklm source add-research` ([Source: `add-research`](cli-reference.md#source-add-research)) for the combined start-and-import workflow.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `start(notebook_id, query, source, mode)` | `str, str, str="web", str="fast"` | `ResearchStart` | Start research (mode: "fast" or "deep"); raises `ValidationError` on invalid source/mode and `DecodingError` if no task is created |
| `poll(notebook_id, task_id=None)` | `str, str \| None = None` | `ResearchTask` | Check research status. If multiple tasks are in flight and `task_id` is omitted, raises `AmbiguousResearchTaskError` |
| `wait_for_completion(notebook_id, task_id=None, *, timeout=1800, initial_interval=5)` | `str, str \| None, float, float` | `ResearchTask` | Wait for research to complete, pinning the discovered task ID between polls. Raises `ResearchTimeoutError` (a `WaitTimeoutError`/`TimeoutError`) and `AmbiguousResearchTaskError` when unpinned polling is ambiguous. |
| `import_sources(notebook_id, task_id, sources)` | `str, str, Sequence[dict[str, Any] \| ResearchSource]` | `list[dict]` | Import findings. Accepts plain dicts **or** the typed `ResearchSource` objects from `poll().sources`. |
| `import_sources_with_verification(notebook_id, task_id, sources, *, max_elapsed=1800, initial_delay=5, backoff_factor=2, max_delay=60, allow_duplicate=False)` | `str, str, Sequence[ResearchSourceInput], float, float, float, float, bool` | `list[dict[str, str]]` | **Preferred for deep research.** Timeout-tolerant: `IMPORT_RESEARCH` commonly outlives one client timeout on deep payloads, so on `RPCTimeoutError` it probes `sources.list` and reconciles what actually committed instead of raising as if nothing imported, retrying the remainder with backoff until `max_elapsed`. Also **idempotent**: requested sources whose URL already exists are skipped unless `allow_duplicate=True`, and are reported on the returned list's `already_present` attribute. |
| `cancel(notebook_id, run_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | Cancel an in-flight run. **Fire-and-forget** — returns `None`, never raises on an unknown id; confirm by polling. `run_id` is `poll().task_id` (for deep research the `report_id` from `start`, **not** the deep `start().task_id` sessionId). |

> **Typed returns.** `start` / `poll` / `wait_for_completion` return the typed
> dataclasses `ResearchStart` / `ResearchTask` (whose `.sources` are
> `ResearchSource` objects), with `.status` a `ResearchStatus` str-enum
> (`status == "completed"` still holds). Use attribute access. `import_sources`
> still accepts `list[dict]` **or** `ResearchSource` objects, so feeding
> `result.sources` straight back in works.

**Which import to call.** `import_sources` is the one-shot RPC; a client-side
timeout on a slow (usually deep) import raises even though the server may have
committed. `import_sources_with_verification` wraps it with reconcile-and-retry
plus URL-level idempotency, and is what the MCP `research_import` tool and the
CLI `research import` / `research wait --import-all` drive. The REST route
(`POST /v1/research/{run_id}/import`) deliberately stays on the one-shot form so
a synchronous web request cannot block on a multi-minute reconcile loop. They are
**not** interchangeable — pick by whether your caller can afford to wait.

**Method Signatures:**

```python
async def start(
    notebook_id: str,
    query: str,
    source: str = "web",   # "web" or "drive"
    mode: str = "fast",    # "fast" or "deep" (deep only for web)
) -> ResearchStart:
    """
    Returns: a ResearchStart with .task_id / .report_id / .notebook_id /
        .query / .mode.
    Raises: ValidationError if source/mode combination is invalid;
        DecodingError if NotebookLM does not create a task.
    """

async def poll(notebook_id: str, task_id: str | None = None) -> ResearchTask:
    """
    Returns a ResearchTask for the selected research task. If task_id is None,
    selects the single visible research task. If multiple tasks are in-flight,
    raises AmbiguousResearchTaskError; pass task_id from start() to disambiguate.
    When task_id is supplied but no in-flight task matches,
    returns ResearchTask.not_found(task_id) — status NOT_FOUND, a typed
    poll-observed-absence sentinel (does not raise); the unfiltered empty poll
    stays NO_RESEARCH. Attributes:
      - task_id:   str            — task/report identifier
      - status:    ResearchStatus — COMPLETED | FAILED | IN_PROGRESS | NO_RESEARCH | NOT_FOUND
                                     (a str enum; == "completed" still holds)
      - query:     str            — original research query
      - sources:   tuple[ResearchSource, ...]
      - summary:   str            — summary text when present
      - report:    str            — deep-research report markdown when present
      - tasks:     tuple[ResearchTask, ...] — ALL parsed tasks visible at this poll
      - status_code: int | None    — raw backend code (task_info[4]) preserved verbatim
      - source_type: int | None    — search source echoed by the backend (1=web, 2=drive)
      - termination_reason: ResearchTerminationReason | None
                                   — WHY the run ended, differentiating the coarse
                                     status: NO_RESULTS | CANCELLED | COMPLETED |
                                     IN_PROGRESS | UNKNOWN. `status` flattens the first
                                     two and UNKNOWN all into FAILED, so branch on this
                                     to tell an empty search from a real error.
                                     None when the poll carried no status code.
      - reason_message: str | None — human-readable explanation, set only when the run
                                     did not succeed
      - hint:      str | None      — remediation matched to the reason and the search
                                     source (an empty Drive search suggests the exact
                                     filename / document id; an empty web search
                                     suggests broadening the query)
      - is_drive_search / is_web_search: bool — whether the search source is KNOWN to be
                                     Drive / web (both False when the tag is absent or
                                     unrecognised, in which case the wording and hint
                                     stay source-agnostic)
      - discovery_mode: DiscoveryMode | None
                                   — the mode the run is EXECUTING under (task_info[2]),
                                     echoed back from the start params: DEFAULT_LLM_SEARCH
                                     for a fast run, DEEP_RESEARCH for a deep one. None
                                     when the poll made no claim; UNKNOWN (distinct from
                                     None) when it named a mode this client cannot map.
      - created_at / updated_at: datetime | None
                                   — UTC-aware start and last-progress instants
                                     (task[3] / task[2]). The backend advances
                                     updated_at while a run is in flight; whether it
                                     stops once the run settles was not observed.
      - duration:  timedelta | None — updated_at - created_at: how long a settled run
                                     took, or how long an in-flight one has been going
                                     as of this poll. None when either timestamp is
                                     missing, and None (with a warning) if the interval
                                     is negative — that means the two positional slots
                                     have moved, not that a run went backwards.
      - account_id: str | None     — opaque account id the run belongs to (task[4]).
                                     Account-scoped (two live accounts, two distinct
                                     stable values); whether it names the run's starter
                                     or the notebook's owner is NOT established.

    Backend status codes are documented in docs/rpc-reference.md (POLL_RESEARCH).

<a id="mindmapsapi-clientmind-maps"></a>

### MindMapsAPI (`client.mind_maps`)

Unified surface over NotebookLM's **two** mind-map kinds (issue #1256): the
**note-backed** kind (JSON tree stored as a note) and the newer **interactive**
kind (a studio artifact, internally `type 4 / variant 4`, created by the web GUI).
Each operation dispatches to the correct backend; you work with `MindMap` /
`MindMapKind` and never see the split.

| Method | Args | Returns | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `list(notebook_id)` | `str` | `list[MindMap]` | Both kinds, as distinct `MindMap` entries. `MindMap.tree` is populated for note-backed entries but `None` for interactive ones (`None` = not fetched, not empty — see below) |
| `list_note_backed(notebook_id)` | `str` | `list[MindMap]` | **Note-backed** entries only (every `kind` is `NOTE_BACKED`, `tree` populated, deleted rows excluded), via a single `GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS` RPC — no `LIST_ARTIFACTS`. Use `list()` for the union with interactive maps |
| `get(notebook_id, mind_map_id)` | `str, str` | `MindMap` | Single mind map by id; raises `MindMapNotFoundError` on a miss |
| `get_or_none(notebook_id, mind_map_id)` | `str, str` | `MindMap \| None` | Sanctioned `None`-on-miss lookup (silent — no deprecation warning) |
| `generate(notebook_id, source_ids=None, *, kind, language="en", instructions=None, wait=True)` | … | `MindMap` | Note-backed (sync) or interactive (`CREATE_ARTIFACT` + poll). A null `CREATE_ARTIFACT` raises `ArtifactFeatureUnavailableError` (a subclass of `ArtifactError`) |
| `rename(notebook_id, mind_map_id, new_title, *, kind=None, return_object=True)` | … | `MindMap \| None` | `UPDATE_NOTE` / `RENAME_ARTIFACT` by kind (re-fetched; raises `MindMapNotFoundError` if missing). `return_object=False` returns `None`. |
| `delete(notebook_id, mind_map_id, *, kind=None)` | … | `None` | `DELETE_NOTE` / `DELETE_ARTIFACT` by kind (idempotent — deleting an already-absent map returns `None`, for both `kind=None` and a supplied `kind`) |
| `get_tree(notebook_id, mind_map_id, *, kind=None)` | … | `dict \| None` | The `{"name","children"}` node tree; `None` for a missing or not-yet-populated map (derived read — does not police existence). The explicit `kind=INTERACTIVE` path delegates absence detection to the RPC (a missing id's value is server-dependent — `None` today) |

`MindMap` is a frozen value: `id`, `notebook_id`, `title`, `kind` (`MindMapKind.NOTE_BACKED` / `INTERACTIVE`), `created_at`, and `tree`. `generate(..., wait=True)` returns `tree` populated for **both** kinds (interactive maps are polled to completion, then their tree is fetched). `list(...)` populates `tree` only for note-backed entries (parsed for free from the listed note content); interactive entries carry `tree=None` ("not fetched", not "empty" — fetching each would cost a separate `GET_INTERACTIVE_HTML`), so call `get_tree(..., kind=INTERACTIVE)` to fetch an individual interactive tree. When `kind` is omitted from `rename`/`delete`/`get_tree`, the backing is auto-detected (one extra list call).

```python
maps = await client.mind_maps.list(nb_id)
for mm in maps:
    print(mm.id, mm.title, mm.kind.value)

# Generate the interactive (web-GUI) kind and poll to completion:
mm = await client.mind_maps.generate(nb_id, kind=MindMapKind.INTERACTIVE)
tree = await client.mind_maps.get_tree(nb_id, mm.id, kind=mm.kind)

await client.mind_maps.rename(nb_id, mm.id, "Renamed", kind=mm.kind)
await client.mind_maps.delete(nb_id, mm.id, kind=mm.kind)
```

In the CLI, mind maps are handled as a **type** within the existing groups (matching
`audio`/`video`/`quiz`): `artifact list --type mind-map`, `artifact rename`,
`artifact delete`, `generate mind-map`, and `download mind-map`.

> The kind-specific `artifacts.generate_mind_map()` / `notes.list_mind_maps()` /
> `notes.delete_mind_map()` remain fully supported for the note-backed kind —
> they are **not** deprecated. `client.mind_maps.*` is the unified surface that
> also reaches the interactive kind; use whichever fits.

### NotesAPI (`client.notes`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Note Commands](cli-reference.md#note-commands-notebooklm-note-cmd) — `notebooklm note list`, `create`, `get`, `save`, `rename`, `delete`.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `list(notebook_id)` | `str` | `list[Note]` | List text notes (excludes mind maps) |
| `create(notebook_id, title="New Note", content="")` | `str, str, str` | `Note` | Create plain-text note (no citation anchors) |
| `get(notebook_id, note_id)` | `str, str` | `Note` | Get note by ID; raises `NoteNotFoundError` on a miss |
| `get_or_none(notebook_id, note_id)` | `str, str` | `Note \| None` | Optional lookup; returns `None` when absent |
| `update(notebook_id, note_id, content, title)` | `str, str, str, str` | `None` | Update note content and title |
| `delete(notebook_id, note_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | Delete note (idempotent; returns `None` whether or not it existed) |
| `list_mind_maps(notebook_id)` | `str` | `list[Any]` | List mind maps in the notebook |
| `delete_mind_map(notebook_id, mind_map_id)` | `str, str` | `None` | Delete a mind map (idempotent; returns `None` whether or not it existed) |

**Example:**
```python
# Create and manage plain-text notes
note = await client.notes.create(nb_id, title="Meeting Notes", content="Discussion points...")
notes = await client.notes.list(nb_id)

# Update a note
await client.notes.update(nb_id, note.id, "Updated content", "New Title")

# Delete a note
await client.notes.delete(nb_id, note.id)

# Save a chat answer as a citation-rich note (preserves [N] hover links).
# Use ``client.chat.save_answer_as_note(...)`` — the chat-owned canonical
# method (the former ``client.notes.create_from_chat(...)`` forwarder was
# removed in v0.7.0).
result = await client.chat.ask(nb_id, "What fruits are mentioned?")
if result.references:
    note = await client.chat.save_answer_as_note(nb_id, result, title="Fruit Citations")
    # Note: the NotebookLM server may auto-generate a "smart" title for
    # citation-rich notes; note.title reflects what the server stored.
```

**Mind Maps:**

Mind maps are stored internally using the same structure as notes but contain JSON data with hierarchical node information. The `list()` method excludes mind maps automatically, while `list_mind_maps()` returns only mind maps.

```python
# List all mind maps in a notebook
mind_maps = await client.notes.list_mind_maps(nb_id)
for mm in mind_maps:
    mm_id = mm[0]  # Mind map ID is at index 0
    print(f"Mind map: {mm_id}")

# Delete a mind map
await client.notes.delete_mind_map(nb_id, mind_map_id)
```

**Note:** Mind maps are detected by checking if the content contains `'"children":' or `'"nodes":'` keys, which indicate JSON mind map data structure.

**Two mind-map kinds (issue #1256):** NotebookLM has two distinct mind-map objects — the **note-backed** kind above (`list_mind_maps()`), and the newer **interactive** kind the web GUI now creates (a studio artifact, internally `type 4 / variant 4`). Both are first-class: the interactive kind appears in `client.artifacts.list(ArtifactType.MIND_MAP)` (and `Artifact.is_interactive_mind_map` distinguishes the backing), `download_mind_map` exports either kind's JSON tree, and the unified [`client.mind_maps`](#mindmapsapi-clientmind-maps) surface generates/reads/renames/deletes both behind a `MindMapKind` discriminator. The `notes.*_mind_map` helpers here remain fully supported for the note-backed kind.

---

### SettingsAPI (`client.settings`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Language Commands](cli-reference.md#language-commands-notebooklm-language-cmd) — `notebooklm language get`, `set`, `list`. Account limits do not yet have a dedicated CLI surface; use `notebooklm status` for context.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `get_output_language()` | none | `Optional[str]` | Get current output language setting |
| `get_account_limits()` | none | `AccountLimits` | Get account-level limits such as max notebooks and sources per notebook |
| `get_user_settings()` | none | `UserSettings` | Get account limits **and** output language in a single request (both share one server call) |
| `set_output_language(language)` | `str` | `Optional[str]` | Set output language for artifact generation |

**Example:**
```python
# Get current language setting
lang = await client.settings.get_output_language()
print(f"Current language: {lang}")  # e.g., "en", "ja", "zh_Hans"

# Get server-reported account limits
limits = await client.settings.get_account_limits()
print(f"Notebook limit: {limits.notebook_limit}")

# Need both limits and language? One request instead of two:
settings = await client.settings.get_user_settings()
print(settings.limits.notebook_limit, settings.output_language)

# Set language for artifact generation
result = await client.settings.set_output_language("ja")  # Japanese
print(f"Language set to: {result}")
```

**Important:** Language is a **GLOBAL setting** that affects all notebooks in your account. Use `get_account_limits()` for quota decisions. Supported languages include:
- `en` (English), `ja` (日本語), `zh_Hans` (中文简体), `zh_Hant` (中文繁體)
- `ko` (한국어), `es` (Español), `fr` (Français), `de` (Deutsch), `pt_BR` (Português)
- And [over 70 other languages](cli-reference.md#language-commands-notebooklm-language-cmd)

---

### SharingAPI (`client.sharing`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Share Commands](cli-reference.md#share-status-public-view-level-add-update-remove) — `notebooklm share status`, `public`, `view-level`, `add`, `update`, `remove`.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `get_status(notebook_id)` | `str` | `ShareStatus` | Get current sharing configuration |
| `set_public(notebook_id, public)` | `str, bool` | `ShareStatus` | Enable/disable public link sharing |
| `set_view_level(notebook_id, level)` | `str, ShareViewLevel` | `ShareStatus` | Set what viewers can access |
| `set_users(notebook_id, grants, notify, welcome_message)` | `str, list[tuple[str, SharePermission]], bool, str` | `ShareStatus` | Set several users' permissions in one request (upsert) |
| `add_user(notebook_id, email, permission, notify, welcome_message)` | `str, str, SharePermission, bool, str` | `ShareStatus` | Share with a user (wrapper over `set_users`) |
| `update_user(notebook_id, email, permission)` | `str, str, SharePermission` | `ShareStatus` | Update user's permission (wrapper over `set_users`) |
| `remove_user(notebook_id, email)` | `str, str` | `ShareStatus` | Remove user's access |

**User permissions are an upsert, not an add.** One `SHARE_NOTEBOOK` call sets the
permission for each email in the batch: an address that is not shared yet is added,
and one that already has access has its permission replaced. `add_user()` and
`update_user()` are intent wrappers over the same `set_users()` operation and differ
only in their default `notify` — `update_user()` will happily add an absent user, and
`add_user()` will happily change an existing one. Two backend preconditions are worth
knowing before you build on this:

- **Duplicate grantees are rejected client-side.** A batch that names one email twice
  comes back *successful* from the backend while that user's permission stays
  unchanged. There is no first-wins or last-wins rule to rely on, so `set_users()`
  raises `ValueError` instead of sending the request. The comparison is **exact**:
  addresses differing only in case are passed through, because RFC 5321 makes the
  local part case-sensitive and no probe has shown that NotebookLM collapses them.
- **Removal stays singular.** A batch of removals only applies when *every* target is
  currently shared; if any requested address is already absent, the backend drops the
  whole request — including the users that are present — and reports no failure.
  A plural removal therefore needs a share-status preflight and post-verification,
  not a wider entry list, so it is deliberately not offered as a one-liner.

**Example:**
```python
from notebooklm import SharePermission, ShareViewLevel

# Get current sharing status
status = await client.sharing.get_status(notebook_id)
print(f"Public: {status.is_public}")
print(f"Users: {[u.email for u in status.shared_users]}")

# Enable public sharing (anyone with link)
status = await client.sharing.set_public(notebook_id, True)
print(f"Share URL: {status.share_url}")

# Set view level (what viewers can access)
await client.sharing.set_view_level(notebook_id, ShareViewLevel.CHAT_ONLY)

# Share with specific users
status = await client.sharing.add_user(
    notebook_id,
    "colleague@example.com",
    SharePermission.VIEWER,
    notify=True,
    welcome_message="Check out my research!"
)

# Set several users' permissions in one RPC. Notifications and the welcome
# message apply to the whole call, not per grant. Existing grantees are updated
# rather than duplicated; repeating one email raises ValueError.
status = await client.sharing.set_users(
    notebook_id,
    [
        ("viewer@example.com", SharePermission.VIEWER),
        ("editor@example.com", SharePermission.EDITOR),
    ],
    notify=True,
    welcome_message="Welcome, team!",
)

# Update user permission
status = await client.sharing.update_user(
    notebook_id,
    "colleague@example.com",
    SharePermission.EDITOR
)

# Remove user access
status = await client.sharing.remove_user(notebook_id, "colleague@example.com")

# Disable public sharing
status = await client.sharing.set_public(notebook_id, False)
```

**Permission Levels:**
- `SharePermission.OWNER` - Full control (read-only, cannot be assigned)
- `SharePermission.EDITOR` - Can edit notebook content
- `SharePermission.VIEWER` - Read-only access

**View Levels:**
- `ShareViewLevel.FULL_NOTEBOOK` - Viewers can access chat, sources, and notes
- `ShareViewLevel.CHAT_ONLY` - Viewers can only access the chat interface

---

### LabelsAPI (`client.labels`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Label Commands](cli-reference.md#label-commands-notebooklm-label-cmd) — `notebooklm label list`, `sources`, `generate`, `create`, `rename`, `emoji`, `add`, `remove`, `delete`.

Source labels group a notebook's sources into topic buckets. A label is a
standalone, notebook-scoped entity: membership is many-to-many (a source can
belong to multiple labels), and a label owns a list of source IDs — the source
carries no back-reference. The dataclass is `Label` (importable as
`from notebooklm import Label`).

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `list(notebook_id)` | `str` | `list[Label]` | List all labels in a notebook (with source membership) |
| `get(notebook_id, label_id)` | `str, str` | `Label` | Get a label by id; raises `LabelNotFoundError` on a miss |
| `get_or_none(notebook_id, label_id)` | `str, str` | `Label \| None` | Get a label by id, returning `None` when absent |
| `sources(notebook_id, label_id)` | `str, str` | `list[Source]` | Expand a label to its `Source` objects (group-as-collection accessor); raises `LabelNotFoundError` if absent |
| `generate(notebook_id, *, scope="unlabeled")` | `str, *, Literal["all", "unlabeled"]` | `list[Label]` | AI-group sources into topic labels (the UI's "Reorganize"). `scope="unlabeled"` (default, safe) labels only unlabeled sources; `scope="all"` is **destructive** — it wipes and regenerates every label with new ids. Returns the full post-op set. |
| `create(notebook_id, name, emoji="")` | `str, str, str` | `Label` | Create an empty, manually-named label. Locates the new label by id-diff; raises `LabelError` on an ambiguous concurrent create |
| `rename(notebook_id, label_id, name, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, str, *, bool` | `Label \| None` | Rename a label (preserves the existing emoji). Raises `LabelNotFoundError` if missing |
| `set_emoji(notebook_id, label_id, emoji, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, str, *, bool` | `Label \| None` | Set a label's emoji |
| `update(notebook_id, label_id, *, name=None, emoji=None, return_object=True)` | `str, str, *, str \| None, str \| None, bool` | `Label \| None` | Set name and/or emoji. Raises `ValueError` if both are `None`; raises `LabelNotFoundError` if the label is missing (in both `return_object` modes) |
| `add_sources(notebook_id, label_id, source_ids, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, list[str], *, bool` | `Label \| None` | Add source(s) to a label. **Appends** — existing members survive and overlap with other labels is allowed. One RPC per id (deduped); not atomic across ids. Raises `ValueError` on an empty list |
| `remove_sources(notebook_id, label_id, source_ids, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, list[str], *, bool` | `Label \| None` | Un-assign source(s) from a label only — the sources survive in the notebook, and a source in another label stays there. Removing a non-member is a no-op. One RPC per id (deduped). Raises `ValueError` on an empty list |
| `delete(notebook_id, label_ids)` | `str, str \| list[str]` | `None` | Delete one or more labels (batch). Idempotent — an absent target is a no-op returning `None`. Deleting a label does not delete its sources |

For `rename`/`set_emoji`/`update`/`add_sources`/`remove_sources`, `return_object=False` returns
`None` without re-hydrating, but the existence preflight still runs and raises
`LabelNotFoundError` on a missing target.

**Example:**
```python
from notebooklm import Label

# AI-group the notebook's unlabeled sources into topic labels (safe default)
labels = await client.labels.generate(nb_id)
for label in labels:
    print(f"{label.id}: {label.emoji or ''}{label.name} ({len(label.source_ids)} sources)")

# Destructive re-label: wipes and regenerates EVERY label with new ids
labels = await client.labels.generate(nb_id, scope="all")

# Create an empty, manually-named label
papers = await client.labels.create(nb_id, "Papers", emoji="📄")

# Add sources (append — does not remove them from any other label)
await client.labels.add_sources(nb_id, papers.id, [source_id])

# Expand a label to its Source objects
members = await client.labels.sources(nb_id, papers.id)
for src in members:
    print(f"{src.id}: {src.title}")

# Read with raise-on-miss vs None-on-miss
label = await client.labels.get(nb_id, papers.id)          # raises LabelNotFoundError
maybe = await client.labels.get_or_none(nb_id, "missing")  # -> None

# Rename (emoji preserved) and re-emoji
await client.labels.rename(nb_id, papers.id, "Research Papers")
await client.labels.set_emoji(nb_id, papers.id, "📚")

# Delete (idempotent; sources become unlabeled, not deleted)
await client.labels.delete(nb_id, papers.id)
```

> **Note:** `add_sources` appends; `remove_sources` un-assigns the source from
> the label only (it is **not** deleted from the notebook, and stays in any other
> label it belongs to). Both issue one `UPDATE_LABEL` per id (the wire honours
> only the first id per call) and are not atomic across ids.

### CollectionsAPI (`client.collections`)

**CLI equivalent:** [Collection Commands](cli-reference.md#collection-commands-notebooklm-collection-cmd) — `notebooklm collection list`, `notebooks`, `create`, `rename`, `add`, `remove`, `delete`.

Collections group whole **notebooks** into named, account-level buckets
(playlist-style) — the account-level sibling of `LabelsAPI` (which groups
sources *within* a notebook). Membership is many-to-many (a notebook can belong
to multiple collections), and a collection owns a list of notebook IDs — the
notebook carries no back-reference. The dataclass is `Collection` (importable as
`from notebooklm import Collection`). On the wire a collection is a type-3 source
label with a null notebook parent, so the same four label RPCs back it.

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|-------------|
| `list()` | - | `list[Collection]` | List all collections in the account (with notebook membership) |
| `get(collection_id)` | `str` | `Collection` | Get a collection by id; raises `CollectionNotFoundError` on a miss |
| `get_or_none(collection_id)` | `str` | `Collection \| None` | Get a collection by id, returning `None` when absent |
| `notebooks(collection_id)` | `str` | `list[Notebook]` | Expand a collection to its `Notebook` objects; raises `CollectionNotFoundError` if absent |
| `create(name)` | `str` | `Collection` | Create an empty, named collection. Locates the new collection by id-diff; raises `CollectionError` on an ambiguous concurrent create |
| `rename(collection_id, name, *, return_object=True)` | `str, str, *, bool` | `Collection \| None` | Rename a collection (preserves the existing emoji). Raises `CollectionNotFoundError` if missing |
| `add_notebooks(collection_id, notebook_ids, *, return_object=True)` | `str, list[str], *, bool` | `Collection \| None` | Add notebook(s) to a collection. **Appends** — existing members survive and a notebook may belong to multiple collections. One RPC per id (deduped); not atomic across ids. Raises `ValueError` on an empty list |
| `remove_notebooks(collection_id, notebook_ids, *, return_object=True)` | `str, list[str], *, bool` | `Collection \| None` | Un-assign notebook(s) from a collection only — the notebooks are not deleted and stay in any other collection. One RPC per id (deduped). Raises `ValueError` on an empty list |
| `delete(collection_ids)` | `str \| list[str]` | `None` | Delete one or more collections (batch). Idempotent — an absent target is a no-op returning `None`. Deleting a collection does not delete its member notebooks |

Collections carry no emoji at creation (the wire has no emoji slot); an emoji set
in the web UI is preserved by `rename`. `return_object=False` always returns `None`
without re-hydrating the collection, but the two mutating families differ on
*when* a missing target is caught: `rename` preflights with `get_or_none` and
raises `CollectionNotFoundError` before issuing the RPC, skipping its post-write
fetch entirely when `return_object=False`; `add_notebooks`/`remove_notebooks`
have no preflight — they issue every membership RPC first, then always call
`get_or_none` afterward (regardless of `return_object`) and raise
`CollectionNotFoundError` there if the collection is gone. So `return_object=False`
never turns into a cheaper existence-only check for `add_notebooks`/`remove_notebooks`.

**Example:**
```python
from notebooklm import Collection

# Create an account-level collection and group notebooks into it
research = await client.collections.create("Research Q3")
await client.collections.add_notebooks(research.id, [nb_id])

# List collections and expand one to its member notebooks
for coll in await client.collections.list():
    print(f"{coll.id}: {coll.emoji or ''}{coll.name} ({len(coll.notebook_ids)} notebooks)")
members = await client.collections.notebooks(research.id)

# Un-assign a notebook (it is NOT deleted) then delete the collection
await client.collections.remove_notebooks(research.id, [nb_id])
await client.collections.delete(research.id)  # notebooks survive
```

## Data Types

### Notebook

```python
@dataclass
class Notebook:
    id: str
    title: str
    created_at: Optional[datetime]   # creation time (tz-aware UTC)
    sources_count: int
    is_owner: bool                     # role is SharePermission.OWNER
    modified_at: Optional[datetime]    # DEPRECATED alias for last_viewed_at
    role: Optional[SharePermission]    # your own level: OWNER / EDITOR / VIEWER
    last_viewed_at: Optional[datetime] # when YOU last opened it (tz-aware UTC)
    emoji: Optional[str]               # Project.emoji; None when unstated
    premium_features: Optional[PremiumFeatureInfo]
    chat_sessions: list[ChatSession]   # populated by CREATE; GET omits it
    chat_settings: Optional[ChatSettings] # current goal/length/persona on get()

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PremiumFeatureInfo:
    can_edit_advanced_settings: bool | None
    can_edit_guidebook_config: bool | None
    can_view_analytics: bool | None

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ChatSession:
    id: str
```

The three premium flags are tri-state: `None` means the response made no usable
claim. `chat_sessions` is normally populated only on the object returned by
`create()`; the client consumes its first id once when the first `chat.ask()` is
made, avoiding a redundant `hPTbtc` lookup. `chat_settings` is populated by
`notebooks.get()`; it stays `None` on `list()` because the listing RPC does not
project the configuration (its null slot cannot distinguish default from a
configured notebook). These richer Project fields are Python API data and do
not silently widen the established CLI/MCP/REST notebook JSON contracts.

#### `last_viewed_at` is not a modification time — and `GET_NOTEBOOK` mutates it

`last_viewed_at` decodes the backend's `lastViewedTime` field. Two things follow
that regularly surprise callers:

1. **It does not track edits.** It advances when *this account* opens the
   notebook, so an untouched notebook keeps getting a newer `last_viewed_at`,
   and a notebook a collaborator just rewrote does not. There is no
   modification timestamp on the wire; do not try to derive one from this
   field.
2. **`GET_NOTEBOOK` is not read-only.** `lastViewedTime` is the sort key the
   backend uses for `ListRecentlyViewedProjects`, and it *writes* the field on
   every notebook fetch. The [#2126](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2126)
   audit saw three consecutive pure reads, with no mutation of any kind, advance
   it `1786105463 → 1786105467 → 1786105471`, and a single bare `GET_NOTEBOOK`
   move that notebook to index 0 of the recency list.

So `notebooks.get()` — plus everything built on `GET_NOTEBOOK` in the table
below — reorders the "Recent" list the human sees in the NotebookLM web UI.
`notebooks.list()` does **not**: a follow-up probe held a notebook's
`last_viewed_at` pinned across 15 seconds of repeated `LIST_NOTEBOOKS`, so
listing reads the ordering without touching it.

There is no read-without-touching notebook fetch, so if this matters for your
automation, budget your `GET_NOTEBOOK`s.
`client.notebooks.remove_from_recent(notebook_id)` is the only way to take a
notebook back out of the list.

Internal call paths that issue a recency-bumping `GET_NOTEBOOK` as a side
effect of doing something else:

| Path | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `chat.ask()` when `source_ids` is not passed | **Most frequent by far** — `get_source_ids()` runs on every ask that does not pin sources explicitly. |
| `sources.list()` / `sources.get()` / `sources.wait_until_ready()` / `wait_all_until_ready()` | Sources are only exposed inside the notebook payload. The waiters re-read **once per poll iteration**, so a slow upload bumps recency a dozen times. |
| `notebooks.get_metadata()` | **Two** `GET_NOTEBOOK`s — it gathers `notebooks.get()` and `sources.list()` concurrently. |
| `notebooks.get_source_ids()` / `get_raw()` | Also reached by every `artifacts.generate_*`, `mind_maps.generate()`, and `notebooks.suggest_prompts()` that does not pin source ids. |
| `notebooks.rename()` | Re-reads after the mutation to return the updated `Notebook`. |
| `notebooks.create()` (CLI/MCP/REST path) | One best-effort re-read to backfill the timestamps `CREATE_NOTEBOOK` leaves null; skipped when both are already populated. |
| `chat.get_settings()` | Chat config lives in the notebook payload. |
| `sources.add_file()` / `add_drive()` / `add_url()` | An **unconditional** pre-create baseline of existing source ids, on every call — the idempotency probe needs it to tell a source it created from one that was already there. (`add_text()` is `NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY` and runs no probe at all, so it never bumps recency.) |
| REST `POST /v1/notebooks/{id}/sources/batch` | One shared existence/auth check before one multi-URL `ADD_SOURCE`; omitted failures trigger one reconciliation `GET_NOTEBOOK`. It never blindly replays a transport-uncertain batch. |

> **`sources.add_drive()` and `sources.add_url()` moved rows**, in
> [#2113](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2113) and
> [#2204](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2204) respectively.
> Both used to probe only on a retry; both now take an **unconditional**
> pre-create baseline, the same shape `add_file` already uses. Neither probe key
> is unique within a notebook — the repo's own cassette holds two source ids
> sharing one Drive `documentId`, and a live probe added the same URL twice and
> got two distinct source ids — so matching on the key alone could return a
> pre-existing copy and report success for a create that never landed. (The
> #2204 probe caught exactly that: a create that *did* land as `df618843-…`
> returned the pre-existing `0d2c15a1-…`.) The baseline is the correct fix —
> this table records the recency cost it carries, not an objection to it. The
> cost is real for `add_url` specifically: `ADD_SOURCE` alone does **not** bump
> `lastViewedTime` (live-verified), so the baseline read is a genuinely new
> side effect on the highest-traffic add path.

Paths that issue `LIST_NOTEBOOKS` — listed for completeness, since they cost an
RPC but, per the probe above, **do not perturb recency**: `notebooks.create()`
(an unconditional idempotency baseline before every create, plus a re-probe and
a quota diagnosis on failure), MCP notebook-name resolution, and the auth
master-token validation probe.

Where a call only needs to know a notebook *exists*, it already uses the
narrowest RPC available — the backend exposes no lighter-weight existence or
status probe than `GET_NOTEBOOK`.

### Source

```python
@dataclass
class Source:
    id: str
    title: Optional[str]
    url: Optional[str]
    created_at: Optional[datetime]
    status: SourceStatus                 # UNKNOWN when the wire status is missing or unmapped
    drive_document_id: Optional[str]     # Drive file id for Drive-backed sources; None otherwise
    drive_status: Optional[DriveSourceStatus]  # Drive-side health; None when the row makes no claim
    download_url: Optional[str]          # Original uploaded file; None when unavailable
    viewer_url: Optional[str]            # Drive viewer for the uploaded file; None when unavailable
    content_mime: Optional[str]          # True MIME from the original-content blob descriptor
    word_count: Optional[int]            # Inferred source word count
    revision_id: Optional[str]           # Opaque source revision identifier
    revision_timestamp: Optional[datetime]  # Timestamp paired with revision_id (tz-aware UTC)
    last_modified_at: Optional[datetime] # Last source content update/refresh (tz-aware UTC)

    @property
    def kind(self) -> SourceType:
        """Get source type as SourceType enum."""

    @property
    def is_ready(self) -> bool:
        """status == SourceStatus.READY"""

    @property
    def is_processing(self) -> bool:
        """status == SourceStatus.PROCESSING"""

    @property
    def is_error(self) -> bool:
        """status == SourceStatus.ERROR"""

    @property
    def is_drive_degraded(self) -> bool:
        """drive_status is one of INACCESSIBLE / SYNCING / DELETED / GEN_AI_ACCESS_DENIED"""
```

> **Removed in v0.5.0:** `Source.source_type` was replaced by `Source.kind`.
> See [stability.md → Removed in v0.5.0](stability.md#removed-in-v050).

Uploaded-file sources may carry `download_url`, `viewer_url`, and
`content_mime`. These describe the retained original file, not the indexed text:
`download_url` retrieves the original bytes, `viewer_url` opens the backend's
Drive viewer, and `content_mime` is the MIME stored with that original-content
blob. They are `None` for source kinds whose rows do not include that blob.

`word_count`, `revision_id`, `revision_timestamp`, and `last_modified_at` expose
metadata already returned by `GET_NOTEBOOK`. The slots and shapes are confirmed
live, but the recovered mobile schema does not name them; `word_count`, the
revision-handle interpretation, and the meaning of `last_modified_at` are
therefore evidence-based names rather than recovered protobuf names.

**Drive-backed sources: `is_ready` is not the whole story.**

`status` (and therefore `is_ready` / `wait_until_ready`) reports **NotebookLM's
own ingestion pipeline**. For a source backed by a Google Drive file, ingestion
completes once and stays complete — even after the file is deleted, unshared, or
starts re-syncing. Drive-side health is a separate wire field
(`SourceSettings.userDriveSourceStatus`) surfaced as `drive_status`:

```python
from notebooklm import DriveSourceStatus

for src in await client.sources.list(nb_id):
    if src.is_drive_degraded:
        print(f"{src.title}: Drive says {src.drive_status.name} — answers may be stale")

    # Or branch on the member directly when you need the specific state:
    if src.drive_status is DriveSourceStatus.DELETED:
        await client.sources.delete(nb_id, src.id)
```

`drive_status` is `None` for every non-Drive source (and for a Drive source the
backend made no claim about — proto3 omits the zero-valued default), so absence
is not proof that a source is not Drive-backed; `drive_document_id` answers that
question. A code this client does not model decodes to `DriveSourceStatus.UNKNOWN`
(distinct from `None`) and logs one warning.

`is_drive_degraded` reports only an **explicit** backend degradation signal. A
`False` therefore means "nothing degraded was reported" — for a non-Drive source,
for `ACTIVE`, and for an unreadable `UNKNOWN` code alike — not "the Drive file is
confirmed present and readable". Note also that `SYNCING` is transient and
self-healing; exclude it if you are driving an alert.

The MCP and REST source views carry the same two signals as
`drive_status_label` (a string, `null` when there is no claim) and
`is_drive_degraded`.

`is_ready` deliberately does **not** fold `drive_status` in: it is a public
field whose meaning callers already depend on, and folding a permanently-dead
Drive file into it would turn `wait_until_ready` into a guaranteed timeout
instead of a signal. Check `is_drive_degraded` alongside `is_ready` when the
freshness of a Drive-backed source matters.

> **Caveat, stated plainly:** only `DriveSourceStatus.ACTIVE` has been observed
> on the wire (4 Drive rows out of a 409-row live capture). The degraded members
> are read off the backend enum recovered from the official Android app; nobody
> has deliberately broken access to a real Drive file to confirm which value
> arrives when. The slot being live, populated and previously unread is
> confirmed; the specific degraded values are not.

**Type Identification:**

Use the `.kind` property to identify source types. It returns a `SourceType` enum which is also a `str`, enabling both enum and string comparisons:

```python
from notebooklm import SourceType

# Enum comparison (recommended)
if source.kind == SourceType.PDF:
    print("This is a PDF")

# String comparison (also works)
if source.kind == "pdf":
    print("This is a PDF")

# Use in f-strings
print(f"Type: {source.kind}")  # "Type: pdf"
```

### Label

```python
@dataclass
class Label:
    id: str
    name: str
    notebook_id: Optional[str] = None
    emoji: Optional[str] = None
    source_ids: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # empty for a new label
```

A source `Label` describes source membership only (no artifact members).
Importable as `from notebooklm import Label`. See
[LabelsAPI](#labelsapi-clientlabels).

### Artifact

```python
@dataclass
class Artifact:
    id: str
    title: str
    _artifact_type: int             # Internal type code; field order matters. Access via .kind.
    status: int                     # See the ArtifactStatus table below. Access via .status_str / .is_* .
    created_at: Optional[datetime]
    url: Optional[str]
    _variant: int | None = None     # Internal variant for type-4 artifacts (1=flashcards, 2=quiz, 4=interactive mind map).
    generation_prompt: str | None = None  # Free-text prompt this artifact was generated from, if any (see get_prompt()).
    media_urls: tuple[ArtifactMedia, ...] = ()
    duration_seconds: float | None = None
    slides: tuple[ArtifactSlide, ...] = ()
    infographics: tuple[ArtifactInfographic, ...] = ()
    report_kind: str | None = None
    source_ids: tuple[str, ...] = ()
    last_modified_at: datetime | None = None
    etag: str | None = None
    user_state: ArtifactUserState | None = None

    @property
    def kind(self) -> ArtifactType:
        """Get artifact type as ArtifactType enum."""

    @property
    def is_completed(self) -> bool:
        """Check if artifact generation is complete (status code 3)."""

    @property
    def is_pending(self) -> bool:
        """Queued: the row exists but the worker has not started (status code 1)."""

    @property
    def is_processing(self) -> bool:
        """Actively generating (status code 2)."""

    @property
    def is_failed(self) -> bool:
        """Generation failed (status code 4)."""

    @property
    def status_str(self) -> str:
        """Human-readable status; see the table below."""

    @property
    def is_quiz(self) -> bool:
        """Check if this is a quiz artifact."""

    @property
    def is_flashcards(self) -> bool:
        """Check if this is a flashcards artifact."""

    @property
    def report_subtype(self) -> str | None:
        """Title-derived report subtype: 'briefing_doc', 'study_guide',
        'blog_post', or 'report' for type-2 artifacts; None otherwise.
        Use this instead of parsing titles in caller code.
        """

    @property
    def report_format(self) -> ReportFormat | None:
        """Typed format for a known report_kind; None for unknown labels."""
```

`media_urls` contains all returned progressive, HLS, DASH, and download
variants; the historical `url` remains the preferred single download URL.
`slides` and `infographics` retain image dimensions, alt text, and full text.
The `ArtifactMedia`, `ArtifactSlide`, `ArtifactInfographic`,
`AudioArtifactUserState`, `FlashcardArtifactUserState`, and
`UnknownArtifactUserState` records are frozen dataclasses exported from
`notebooklm`. Unknown media type codes and user-state shapes preserve their raw
identity instead of being discarded. `report_kind` likewise retains an unknown
backend label verbatim while `report_format` maps labels the client recognizes.

**Note on `_artifact_type` / `_variant`:** these are private (leading-underscore) fields with `repr=False` and are part of the dataclass for `from_api_response()` round-tripping. Always consume them via the public `.kind`, `.is_quiz`, `.is_flashcards`, and `.report_subtype` accessors.

**Status codes** (`Artifact.status`, also available as the `ArtifactStatus` enum from `notebooklm.types`):

| Code | `ArtifactStatus` | `status_str` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `UNKNOWN` | `"unknown"` | Status unset or unrecognized |
| 1 | `PENDING` | `"pending"` | Queued — the row exists, the worker has not started |
| 2 | `PROCESSING` | `"in_progress"` | Actively generating |
| 3 | `COMPLETED` | `"completed"` | Ready for use/download |
| 4 | `FAILED` | `"failed"` | Generation failed |
| 5 | `SUGGESTED` | `"suggested"` | A suggestion row, not a real artifact; filtered out of listings server-side |
| 6 | `PENDING_REVIEW` | `"pending_review"` | Backend state whose semantics are unconfirmed; modeled so it stays distinguishable from `"unknown"` |

**Corrected in [#2127](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2127):**
codes 1 and 2 were transposed relative to the backend — the library read 1 as
`"in_progress"` and 2 as `"pending"`. `Artifact.is_pending` therefore returned
`True` for an artifact that was mid-generation, and `is_processing` returned
`False` for it. No member name or existing status string was renamed; what moved
is the wire code behind each, and codes 0/5/6 gained members where they had
previously all decoded to `"unknown"` (so `"suggested"` and `"pending_review"`
are new strings an exhaustive match must now handle). Callers that hard-coded
the integers (`artifact.status == 1` to mean "generating") must flip them;
callers using `.is_pending` / `.is_processing` / `.status_str` get the correct
answer with no change.

> **Removed in v0.5.0:** `Artifact.artifact_type` and `Artifact.variant`
> were replaced by `Artifact.kind` plus `.is_quiz` / `.is_flashcards`.
> See [stability.md → Removed in v0.5.0](stability.md#removed-in-v050).

**Type Identification:**

Use the `.kind` property to identify artifact types. It returns an `ArtifactType` enum which is also a `str`:

```python
from notebooklm import ArtifactType

# Enum comparison (recommended)
if artifact.kind == ArtifactType.AUDIO:
    print("This is an audio overview")

# String comparison (also works)
if artifact.kind == "audio":
    print("This is an audio overview")

# Check specific types
if artifact.is_quiz:
    print("This is a quiz")
elif artifact.is_flashcards:
    print("This is a flashcard deck")
```

### GenerationStatus

Returned by `poll_status`, `wait_for_completion`, and most artifact generation methods (`generate_audio`, `generate_video`, `generate_report`, `generate_quiz`, `generate_flashcards`, `generate_slide_deck`, `generate_infographic`, `generate_data_table`). Note that `generate_mind_map` returns a `dict[str, Any]` instead — the mind map is delivered as JSON inline rather than polled.

```python
@dataclass
class GenerationStatus:
    task_id: str                          # Same value as Artifact.id once complete
    status: GenerationState               # str-Enum; see the member table below for all nine values
    url: str | None = None                # Populated for media artifacts when status == "completed"
    error: str | None = None
    error_code: str | None = None         # e.g. "USER_DISPLAYABLE_ERROR" for rate limits
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None

    @property
    def is_in_progress(self) -> bool:
        """Check if generation is in progress."""

    @property
    def is_pending(self) -> bool:
        """Check if generation is pending."""

    @property
    def is_not_found(self) -> bool:
        """Check if the artifact is absent from the poll response.

        silently removed server-side (e.g. after a daily-quota rejection).
        ``wait_for_completion`` treats a sustained run of ``not_found``

`status` is a `GenerationState(str, Enum)` (importable from `notebooklm` and
`notebooklm.types`), so it remains a `str` for every existing use — `status ==
"completed"`, `status in {...}`, `f"{status}"`, and `json.dumps` all keep
working unchanged. **Prefer the `.is_*` predicates** (`status.is_complete`,
`status.is_failed`, …) over raw string comparison for new code; the raw
`status == "completed"` form stays supported.

| `GenerationState` member | Value | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | `"pending"` | poll / generation parsers (also the default when no status code is reported yet) |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | `"in_progress"` | poll / generation parsers |
| `COMPLETED` | `"completed"` | poll / generation parsers |
| `FAILED` | `"failed"` | poll / generation parsers; synthesized rate-limit retry events |
| `NOT_FOUND` | `"not_found"` | `poll_status` when the artifact is absent from the list |
| `UNKNOWN` | `"unknown"` | status code 0, plus any code outside the backend enum (future-proofing) |
| `SUGGESTED` | `"suggested"` | status code 5 — a suggestion row; listings filter these out server-side |
| `PENDING_REVIEW` | `"pending_review"` | status code 6 — backend state with unconfirmed semantics ([#2127](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2127)) |
| `REMOVED` | `"removed"` | `wait_for_completion` after a sustained delisting |

`GenerationState.is_terminal` is the single authority for "generation ended":
it is `True` for exactly `COMPLETED`, `FAILED` and `REMOVED`. Everything else —
including `NOT_FOUND`, `UNKNOWN`, and the `SUGGESTED` / `PENDING_REVIEW` states
added in #2127 — means *keep waiting*, so `wait_for_completion` keeps polling
and the REST poll route keeps the task in its pending registry. Prefer it over
enumerating members yourself — and since `GenerationStatus.is_terminal`
delegates to it, branch on the status object:

```python
status = await client.artifacts.poll_status(nb_id, task_id)
if not status.is_terminal:
    ...  # still running; poll again
```

`NOT_FOUND` is non-terminal but is *not* interchangeable with the others: it
means the artifact is absent from the listing (post-create lag, or a delisting)
rather than reporting an outcome, and `wait_for_completion` escalates a
sustained run of it to the terminal `REMOVED`. Branch on `is_not_found` when
that difference matters.

> **Note:** because `status` is now typed `GenerationState`, constructing
> `GenerationStatus(..., status="completed")` with a bare string literal is a
> `mypy` type error under strict settings — pass a member
> (`GenerationState.COMPLETED`) instead. This only affects callers who build
> `GenerationStatus` themselves; the library's own producers already do. All
> *reading* comparisons (`status == "completed"`) remain valid because
> `GenerationState` subclasses `str`.

**`url` semantics:** `poll_status` populates `url` for media artifact types (audio, video, infographic, slide-deck PDF) as soon as the server reports the asset as ready.

`next_steps` decodes the `NextStepSuggestions` block the backend includes with
live answers. A normal chat follow-up uses
`MagicArtifactType.CONVERSATIONAL_TEXT_CHIP` (`9`). The raw `type_code` remains
available even when a newer backend sends an enum value this client does not
yet know; in that case `kind` is `None` rather than dropping the suggestion.
MCP and REST ask responses serialize each item as `{question, type_code}`.

#### Three coordinate spaces, and which field lives in which

Citations carry offsets into three different strings. Mixing them up was
[#2120](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2120); the field names
now say which is which.

| Field | Resolve against | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| `start_char` / `end_char` | `SourceFulltext.document.slice(...)` | The cited fragment's span in the **source** document, derived from its blocks. UTF-16 code units, like every offset here. |
| `fragment_start_char` / `fragment_end_char` | same | The same span as the **server** declares it, rather than derived. The two have agreed on every capture so far; a divergence means the server and this client no longer read the fragment the same way. |
| `answer_anchor_start` / `answer_anchor_end` | `AskResult.answer_document.slice(...)` | Where **in the answer** this citation applies, from the answer's annotation map. |

None of them index `AskResult.answer` or `SourceFulltext.content`. `answer`
carries markdown emphasis and the inline `[N]` markers the document does not;
`content` is a legacy newline-joined rendering whose separators the backend
never counted.

```python
result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, question)
for ref in result.references:
    # Which part of the answer does this citation back? (None when the answer
    # carried no anchor for it — slice() absorbs that and returns "".)
    supported = result.answer_document.slice(
        ref.answer_anchor_start, ref.answer_anchor_end
    )
    # ...and what does it quote from the source?
    fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(notebook_id, ref.source_id)
    quoted = fulltext.document.slice(ref.start_char, ref.end_char)
    # `quoted` and `ref.cited_text` normally agree; see the note below on when
    # they don't.
```

An `answer_anchor_*` pair is frequently zero-width — the backend anchors a
citation at its `[N]` marker's insertion point rather than over a span — which
is why it is named "anchor" rather than "range". A reference the answer did not
annotate keeps `None` on both.

`cited_text` is what the fragment says, verbatim — every block's text
concatenated. Before #2120 it stopped at the fragment's first block: 37
characters of an available 556 in that same capture (a different citation from
the `[1130, 1695]` one above). Its length equals `end_char - start_char` for an
ordinary prose fragment, but comes out *short* when the fragment spans
positions this client does not render as text, and can run a few characters
*long* when a span's text length disagrees with its declared range. Use
`document.slice(ref.start_char, ref.end_char)` when you need a string whose
length is guaranteed — it pads and clips to the declared range; `cited_text` is
the reading that stays readable.

`SourceFulltext.find_citation_context()` remains for fuzzy lookup against the
flat `content`, but prefer `document.slice()`: it is exact, and it needs no
search.

`resolve_chat_reference_passage()` now does that for you
([#2211](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2211)). It reads the
passage out of the citation's own range and returns it in the readable
rendering, falling back to the `content` search only for a reference with no
usable range or a source whose document did not decode:

```python
from notebooklm import resolve_chat_reference_passage

passage = await resolve_chat_reference_passage(client, notebook_id, ref)
```

Three checks stand the range down, all of them falling back to the search
rather than returning a passage that only looks right:

- it must **fit** the document (`end <= document.extent`), which catches a
  source re-indexed shorter;
- it must **render something** on its own, before any context window is added,
  so a citation covering only an image is not handed its neighbours' prose;
- when the reference also carries `cited_text`, the two must **agree** — a
  bounded prefix of `cited_text` has to appear in `document.slice(start, end)`.
  This is the case `extent` cannot see: a source re-indexed *longer* leaves the
  stale range fitting and resolving, to the wrong passage. `cited_text` is used
  as a cross-check here, never as a locator.

A reference carrying neither a range nor `cited_text` — a citation whose
fragment decoded no blocks at all — still raises `ChatResponseParseError`
without issuing a request. A fragment holding only an image *does* carry a
range, so resolving it takes the fetch and then raises.

**Tip:** Cache `fulltext` when processing multiple citations from the same source to avoid repeated API calls.

### ShareStatus

```python
@dataclass
class ShareStatus:
    notebook_id: str                   # The notebook ID
    is_public: bool                    # Whether publicly accessible
    access: ShareAccess                # RESTRICTED or ANYONE_WITH_LINK
    view_level: ShareViewLevel         # FULL_NOTEBOOK or CHAT_ONLY
    shared_users: list[SharedUser]     # List of users with access
    share_url: str | None              # Public URL if is_public=True
    max_individuals_share_limit: int | None   # Collaborator cap; None = no claim
    is_public_sharing_allowed: bool | None    # Policy gate; None = no claim
```

**Collaborator cap and public-sharing policy.**

`GET_SHARE_STATUS` reports two fields this client read for a long time as
nothing at all (the parser docstring described the cap as the bare literal
`1000`):

* `max_individuals_share_limit` — the per-notebook collaborator cap the backend
  enforces. Without it a bulk-share caller discovers the ceiling only as a
  failed RPC.
* `is_public_sharing_allowed` — the tenant/policy gate on making a notebook
  public.

Both use `None` for "the response made no claim", but they are not the same
shape. `max_individuals_share_limit` is `int | None` — a cap, or no cap stated.
`is_public_sharing_allowed` is the genuinely **tri-state** one, `bool | None`,
where the third state is what makes it easy to misread:

```python
status = await client.sharing.get_status(nb_id)

if status.is_public_sharing_denied:
    print("This tenant forbids public sharing.")
elif status.is_public_sharing_allowed is None:
    print("The backend did not say; attempting anyway.")

if status.max_individuals_share_limit is not None:
    print(f"Backend-enforced collaborator cap: {status.max_individuals_share_limit}")
```

`None` means *the response made no claim* — it is deliberately not collapsed
into `False` / `0`, because "the backend did not say" and "the backend said no"
lead a caller to opposite decisions.

Prefer the `is_public_sharing_denied` property over hand-writing the
comparison. The idiomatic spelling `not status.is_public_sharing_allowed` is
**wrong**: it is also `True` for the unknown case, so it reports a denial the
backend never made. `is_public_sharing_denied` is `True` only for an explicit
wire `False`; a `False` from it means "no denial was reported", not "public
sharing is confirmed available". The MCP and REST views ship the same verdict
as an `is_public_sharing_denied` key.

> **How the cap is counted is NOT established.** `shared_users` includes the
> **owner** (live-confirmed: an owner row is present on every notebook
> observed), and whether the owner counts against `maxIndividualsShareLimit` was
> never tested — no account was taken anywhere near 1000 collaborators. So
> `max_individuals_share_limit - len(shared_users)` is plausible but unverified,
> and plausibly off by one. Treat the cap as the backend's stated ceiling, not
> as an operand in arithmetic this project has confirmed.

> **`set_public` deliberately does not consult the gate.** Making it pre-check
> `is_public_sharing_allowed` would add an RPC round-trip to every call and
> change a public method's failure mode on the strength of a consequence that
> has **not** been observed: the audit records the silent-no-op as *plausible*,
> and no tenant with public sharing disabled was available to exercise it. The
> field is surfaced so a caller can make that decision with the evidence in
> hand; wiring it into the mutation path is a separate change that needs a
> tenant where the branch can actually be tested.
>
> **Caveat, stated plainly:** every notebook sampled (10/10, 2026-08) returned
> `1000` and `True`. The `False` branch of `is_public_sharing_allowed` has never
> been observed on the wire — only its decoding is pinned by tests.

The MCP and REST share views and `notebooklm share status --json` carry both
fields under the same names.

### SharedUser

```python
@dataclass
class SharedUser:
    email: str                         # User's email address
    permission: SharePermission        # OWNER, EDITOR, or VIEWER
    display_name: str | None           # User's display name
    avatar_url: str | None             # URL to user's avatar image
```

### AccountLimits

Returned by `client.settings.get_account_limits()`. Use these fields for
quota decisions — the server-reported limits are what NotebookLM actually
enforces.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AccountLimits:
    notebook_limit: int | None = None  # Max notebooks the account can hold
    source_limit: int | None = None    # Max sources per notebook
    raw_limits: tuple[Any, ...] = ()   # Untouched RPC payload for forensic use
    tier: int | None = None            # Subscription tier enum (opaque; see below)
```

`tier` is the subscription tier read from the same authoritative `GET_USER_SETTINGS`
limits block (index 4). It is an **opaque enum key, not an ordinal rank** — look it up,
never compare with `<`/`>`. Mapping (per
[Google's plan table](https://support.google.com/notebooklm/answer/16213268)):
`1`=Standard/Free, `2`=Pro, `4`=Plus, `3`=Ultra (20 TB), `6`=Ultra (30 TB); `5` aligns
with the Workspace "Expanded" access level (inferred — not a consumer plan, so it is
absent from Google's consumer page); Enterprise is separate.
Only `1` and `2` are live-confirmed. `tier` is `None` on legacy 4-element blocks or when
the value is absent/non-positive. (The pre-v0.8.0 promotions-based tier / `plan_name`
label is **not** back — it could not distinguish free from paid; this reads the real
quota block instead.) The full per-tier notebook/source/studio limits keyed to these
ints are in [quota-limits.md](quota-limits.md).

### UserSettings

Returned by `client.settings.get_user_settings()`. A single account-settings
request carries both the account limits and the output language, so this is the
one-call path when you need both (`get_account_limits()` and
`get_output_language()` each make their own request).

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class UserSettings:
    limits: AccountLimits = AccountLimits()  # Account-level quota limits
    output_language: str | None = None       # Global output language, or None
```

### SourceFulltext

```python
@dataclass
class SourceFulltext:
    source_id: str                     # UUID of the source
    title: str                         # Source title
    content: str                       # Flat text (legacy rendering; see below)
    url: str | None                    # Original URL (if applicable)
    char_count: int                    # len(content)
    document: StructuredDocument       # Parsed document tree (#2128)

    @property
    def kind(self) -> SourceType:
        """Get source type as SourceType enum."""

    @property
    def rendered_content(self) -> str:
        """Readable rendering derived from `document`: one line per block."""

    def find_citation_context(
        self,
        cited_text: str,
        context_chars: int = 200,
    ) -> list[tuple[str, int]]:
        """Search for citation text, return list of (context, position) tuples."""
```

> **Removed in v0.5.0:** `SourceFulltext.source_type` was replaced by
> `SourceFulltext.kind`. See
> [stability.md → Removed in v0.5.0](stability.md#removed-in-v050).

#### `content` vs `document` vs `rendered_content`

The backend returns a source's text as a `TailwindDoc` tree — headings, list
structure, per-run styling, and a character offset on every node. `content` is
the flat rendering of that tree this client has always produced: every text run
joined with `"\n"` in traversal order. It is unchanged and will stay unchanged.
It is also **not** the backend's coordinate space, because those joins insert
separators the wire's offsets never accounted for, which is why a citation's
`start_char` could never be used against it
([#2128](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2128)).

`document` is the same response parsed instead of flattened. It costs no extra
request, and it is populated for both `output_format` values — that flag picks
which flat rendering fills `content`, not what the payload contains:

```python
fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(notebook_id, source_id)
ref = (await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, question)).references[0]

for block in fulltext.document.blocks:
    if block.heading_level:
        print("#" * block.heading_level, block.text)
    elif block.is_list_item:
        print(f"{'  ' * block.list_info.nesting_level}{block.list_info.glyph} {block.text}")
    else:
        print(block.text)

# The coordinate space citations index:
fulltext.document.slice(ref.start_char, ref.end_char)
```

`rendered_content` is the third reading, and the one meant for a human
([#2211](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2211)). `content`
joins every text *run* with `"\n"`, and a run is a sub-paragraph fragment — so
a paragraph the backend split into three runs becomes three lines. On the
captured source in `tests/unit/fixtures/source_fulltext_tailwind_doc.json`
that turns 13 blocks into 17 lines. Since the tree is parsed,
`rendered_content` renders from it instead: runs joined *within* a block,
blocks separated, blocks with nothing to read (an image, a rule) omitted. It
costs no extra request, `content` does not move, and like `content` it is
deliberately **not** offset-addressable — its separators are its own. It is
also marker-free: list glyphs and heading levels stay on `blocks` rather than
being rendered, so this is the flat rendering `content` should have been, not
a markdown one. A **table** is the one block that is not one line: it renders
one line per row with its cells tab-separated, read from the cell offsets the
parse carries on `DocumentBlock.table_rows`
([#2230](https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2230)). Those are
offsets only — `document.text`, `DocumentBlock.text` and `cited_text` are
byte-for-byte what they were, and the tab lives in the rendering alone.

With `output_format="markdown"` the two are not the same material: `content`
is then built from the response's HTML rendition while `document` — and so
`rendered_content` — is still parsed from its text blocks.

```python
fulltext.content            # 17 lines: "…light energy into\n \nchemical energy."
fulltext.rendered_content   # 13 lines: "…light energy into chemical energy."
fulltext.document.text      # 532 units, no separators at all — the offset space
```

`document` and `rendered_content` are Python-API surfaces: the CLI `--json`,
MCP and REST fulltext payloads stay pinned to their existing key sets. Those
payloads do carry `char_count`, which counts Python characters of `content` —
and `source read --offset` keeps windowing `content` in those same units, not
in the document's.

`StructuredDocument` exposes `blocks` (`DocumentBlock`: `start_index`,
`end_index`, `spans`, `style`, `list_info`, `kind`, `table_rows` — a tuple of
rows of `TableCell` ranges, non-empty only for a `BlockKind.TABLE`),
`annotations`
(`DocumentAnnotation`: `object_id`, `start_index`, `end_index`), `text`,
`extent`, `slice()`, `render()` and `annotations_for()`. Each `TextSpan`
carries its own range plus `bold` / `italic` / `underline` / `url`.
`render(start, end)` is `rendered_content` over one range — the readable
counterpart of `slice(start, end)`, though it takes both bounds or neither and
raises on a half-specified range, where `slice` absorbs a `None` bound and
returns `""`. `extent` is the document's total width in UTF-16 units, i.e. the
upper bound of the coordinate space: a range is *in range* when
`0 <= start < end <= extent`. That is necessary and not sufficient — a range
inside it can still cover only positions that decoded no text.

`text` is laid out at the backend's own offsets, so `slice(n, m)` is exactly
what the backend meant by `[n, m)`. Positions the document occupies but whose
text this client cannot render carry `"\ufffc"` (OBJECT REPLACEMENT CHARACTER,
the same placeholder Google's own document APIs use) rather than collapsing —
collapsing them is what would pull every later character out of alignment. Use
`block.text` when you want only what actually decoded.

> **Use `slice()`, not `text[n:m]`.** Every offset on the wire is a **UTF-16
> code unit** — the JavaScript convention — while Python indexes code points.
> The two agree until the document's first astral character and then differ by
> one position per such character, so an answer containing a single emoji makes
> plain indexing return neighbouring text from there on. `slice()` does the
> translation; `notebooklm.types.utf16_len()` is exported for callers doing
> their own offset arithmetic.

Tables *are* decoded — their cell text is flattened into the table block's
spans, so an infobox does not become filler. `BlockKind` tells you what any
remaining filler is: `IMAGE` and `HORIZONTAL_RULE` genuinely carry no text,
while `CODE_BLOCK` and `THOUGHT` carry text on the wire that this client does
not decode yet.

**Type Identification:**

Like `Source`, use the `.kind` property to get the source type:

```python
fulltext = await client.sources.get_fulltext(nb_id, source_id)
print(f"Content type: {fulltext.kind}")  # "pdf", "web_page", etc.
```

class SourceType(str, Enum):
    """Source types - use with source.kind property.

    This is a str enum, enabling both enum and string comparisons:
        source.kind == SourceType.PDF   # True
        source.kind == "pdf"            # Also True

    WEB_PAGE = "web_page"
    GOOGLE_DRIVE_AUDIO = "google_drive_audio"
    GOOGLE_DRIVE_VIDEO = "google_drive_video"
    YOUTUBE = "youtube"
    MARKDOWN = "markdown"
    DOCX = "docx"
    POWERPOINT = "powerpoint"
    CSV = "csv"
    EPUB = "epub"
    IMAGE = "image"
    MEDIA = "media"
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"

class ArtifactType(str, Enum):
    """Artifact types - use with artifact.kind property.

    This is a str enum that hides internal variant complexity.
    Quizzes and flashcards are distinguished automatically.
    """
    AUDIO = "audio"

    SLIDE_DECK = "slide_deck"
    DATA_TABLE = "data_table"
    FANTASY_MAP = "fantasy_map"
    FILE = "file"
    UNKNOWN = "unknown"

class SourceStatus(Enum):
    UNKNOWN = -1     # Status is absent, malformed, or not yet mapped
    PROCESSING = 1  # Source is being processed (indexing content)
    READY = 2       # Source is ready for use
    ERROR = 3       # Source processing failed
    PREPARING = 5   # Source is being prepared/uploaded (pre-processing stage)

class DriveSourceStatus(Enum):
    """Drive-side health of a Drive-backed source — NOT ingestion status."""
    UNKNOWN = -1              # Client sentinel: slot populated with a code we cannot map
    INACCESSIBLE = 1          # The account can no longer read the Drive file
    SYNCING = 2               # The Drive file is being (re-)synced (transient)
    ACTIVE = 3                # In sync — the only value observed live
    DELETED = 4               # The Drive file has been deleted
    GEN_AI_ACCESS_DENIED = 5  # AI access to the file is denied (e.g. Workspace policy)

# The backend's DRIVE_SOURCE_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED (0) is deliberately not modelled:
# it means "no claim", which is what `drive_status is None` already means, so an
# explicit 0 is normalized to None rather than giving one state two spellings.


class DiscoveryMode(Enum):
    """How a research run searched for sources — `ResearchTask.discovery_mode`."""

    UNKNOWN = -1             # Client sentinel: slot populated with a code we cannot map
    DEFAULT_LLM_SEARCH = 1   # Sent + observed for mode="fast"
    RAW_SEARCH = 2           # Never sent by this client
    CURIOUS_SEARCH = 3       # Never sent by this client
    CURIOUS_RAW_SEARCH = 4   # Never sent by this client
    DEEP_RESEARCH = 5        # Sent + observed for mode="deep"
    LITE_LLM_SEARCH = 6      # Never sent by this client


# Same UNSPECIFIED(0) treatment as DriveSourceStatus above. Only 1 and 5 have been
# observed — they are the two this client sends, and the poll echoes them back, so
# the mode a run is executing under is confirmable rather than merely remembered.
# `notebooklm.types.discovery_mode_to_str` maps a member to its lower-snake label.
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
from notebooklm import ArtifactType, SourceStatus, SourceType

# Request the source families and states you need directly.
sources = await client.sources.list(
    nb_id,
    statuses={SourceStatus.READY},
    types={SourceType.PDF, SourceType.MEDIA, SourceType.IMAGE, SourceType.UNKNOWN},
)
for src in sources:
    if src.kind == SourceType.PDF:
        print(f"PDF: {src.title}")
    elif src.kind == SourceType.MEDIA:
        print(f"Audio/Video: {src.title}")
    elif src.kind == SourceType.IMAGE:
        print(f"Image (OCR'd): {src.title}")
    elif src.kind == SourceType.UNKNOWN:
        print(f"Unknown type: {src.title}")

# List artifacts by type using .kind property
artifacts = await client.artifacts.list(nb_id)
for art in artifacts:
    if art.kind == ArtifactType.AUDIO:
        print(f"Audio: {art.title}")
    elif art.kind == ArtifactType.VIDEO:
        print(f"Video: {art.title}")
    elif art.kind == ArtifactType.QUIZ:
        print(f"Quiz: {art.title}")
```

### Chat Configuration

```python
class ChatGoal(Enum):
    DEFAULT = 1        # General purpose
    CUSTOM = 2         # Uses custom_prompt
    LEARNING_GUIDE = 3 # Educational focus

class ChatResponseLength(Enum):
    DEFAULT = 1
    LONGER = 4
    SHORTER = 5

class ChatMode(Enum):
    """Predefined chat modes for common use cases (service-level enum)."""
    DEFAULT = "default"          # General purpose
    LEARNING_GUIDE = "learning_guide"  # Educational focus
    CONCISE = "concise"          # Brief responses
    DETAILED = "detailed"        # Verbose responses
```

**ChatGoal vs ChatMode:**
- `ChatGoal` is an RPC-level enum used with `client.chat.configure()` for low-level API configuration
- `ChatMode` is a service-level enum providing predefined configurations for common use cases

## Advanced Usage

### Custom RPC Calls

For undocumented features, you can make raw RPC calls:

```python
from notebooklm.rpc import RPCMethod

async with NotebookLMClient.from_storage() as client:
    # Each RPCMethod member has its own params shape (a nested list) and
    # source_path; mirror the higher-level APIs when in doubt.
    result = await client.rpc_call(
        RPCMethod.CREATE_NOTEBOOK,
        params=["My Notebook", None, None, [2, None, None, [1, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, [1]]]],
    )
```

### Handling Rate Limits

Google rate limits aggressive API usage:

For artifact-generation methods, use the shared generation retry helper:

```python
from notebooklm.artifacts import with_rate_limit_retry

status = await with_rate_limit_retry(
    lambda: client.artifacts.generate_audio(notebook_id),
    max_retries=3,
)
```

### Streaming Chat Responses

The chat endpoint supports streaming (internal implementation):

```python
# Standard (non-streaming) - recommended
result = await client.chat.ask(nb_id, "Question")
print(result.answer)

# Streaming is handled internally by the library
# The ask() method returns the complete response
```

---

## Utility and Helper APIs

The following public APIs are available under the top-level `notebooklm` namespaces for logging, research citation processing, and metadata-aware capability implementations.

### Chat Citation Utilities

#### `notebooklm.utils.resolve_chat_reference_passage`

Locates the surrounding paragraph/passage of source text for a specific `ChatReference` citation. Since chat streaming returns only the matching citation fragment, this helper performs a single round-trip to pull the full source text and extract the surrounding context.

It reads the citation's own `start_char` / `end_char` range out of the source document and returns that window in the readable rendering, falling back to the `content` prefix search only when the range is unusable — absent, zero-width, past `document.extent`, or against a source whose document did not decode. A reference with neither a range nor `cited_text` raises `ChatResponseParseError` without issuing a request. See [`content` vs `document` vs `rendered_content`](#content-vs-document-vs-rendered_content).

```python
async def resolve_chat_reference_passage(
    client: NotebookLMClient,
    notebook_id: str,
    reference: ChatReference,
    context_chars: int = 200,
) -> str:
    """Return the surrounding source-text passage for a chat citation."""
```

Example:
```python
from notebooklm import resolve_chat_reference_passage

ask_result = await client.chat.ask(notebook_id, "Explain quantum computing")
first_ref = ask_result.references[0]

passage = await resolve_chat_reference_passage(
    client, notebook_id, first_ref, context_chars=150
)
print(f"Context: {passage}")
```

### Artifact Generation Helpers

These helpers live in `notebooklm.artifacts` and can be used with any
artifact-generation callable that returns `GenerationStatus`.

#### `notebooklm.artifacts.with_rate_limit_retry`

```python
async def with_rate_limit_retry(
    generate_fn: Callable[[], Awaitable[GenerationStatus | None]],
    *,
    max_retries: int,
    initial_delay: float = 60.0,
    max_delay: float = 300.0,
    multiplier: float = 2.0,
    sleep: Callable[[float], Awaitable[Any]] | None = None,
    on_retry: Callable[[RateLimitRetryEvent], object | Awaitable[object]] | None = None,
) -> GenerationStatus | None:
    """Run an artifact-generation callable with rate-limit retry."""
```

`sleep` lets tests or schedulers provide their own async wait function.
`on_retry` receives a `RateLimitRetryEvent` before each retry sleep.

Example:
```python
from notebooklm.artifacts import with_rate_limit_retry

status = await with_rate_limit_retry(
    lambda: client.artifacts.generate_video(notebook_id),
    max_retries=3,
)
```

### Research Extraction and Citation Filtering

These are free/pure functions provided in the `notebooklm.research` module to inspect research reports and parse, normalize, or filter citations.

#### `notebooklm.research.normalize_url`

```python
def normalize_url(url: str) -> str:
    """Normalize source/report URLs for citation matching."""
```

#### `notebooklm.research.extract_report_urls`

```python
def extract_report_urls(report: str) -> set[str]:
    """Extract normalized URLs from research report markdown/text."""
```

#### `notebooklm.research.select_cited_sources`

```python
def select_cited_sources(
    sources: Sequence[dict[str, Any] | ResearchSource],
    report: str,
) -> CitedSourceSelection:
    """Return research sources cited by the completed report.

    Falls back to the original source list if no cited URLs are resolved.
    """
```

Example:
```python
from notebooklm.research import select_cited_sources

status = await client.research.wait_for_completion(notebook_id, task_id=task_id)
# Filter only the sources that were explicitly cited in the report markdown
selection = select_cited_sources(status.sources, status.report)

print(f"Total sources: {len(status.sources)}")
print(f"Cited sources: {len(selection.sources)}")
```

### Log Correlation and Context Primitives

Used to configure logging and tag asynchronous execution paths with a persistent correlation ID for tracking requests across concurrency seams.

#### `notebooklm.configure_logging`

```python
def configure_logging() -> None:
    """Initialize package logging with redactors and correlation support."""
```

#### `notebooklm.get_request_id`, `set_request_id`, `reset_request_id`

```python
def get_request_id() -> str | None:
    """Return the current correlation id, or None if unset."""

def set_request_id(req_id: str | None = None) -> Token[str | None]:
    """Set the correlation id for this Task/context, returning a ContextVar Token."""

def reset_request_id(token: Token[str | None]) -> None:
    """Restore the correlation id to its previous value."""
```

#### `notebooklm.correlation_id`

An asynchronous-safe context manager that manages correlation ID state.

```python
import logging
from notebooklm import correlation_id

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

with correlation_id("my-custom-flow-id"):
    # All logging statements within this block are tagged with the ID
    logger.info("Starting RPC call...")
```

### Capability Protocols (Extension Surface)

Decomposed Protocols introduced in ADR-0013 to decouple service facades from target domain runtimes.

#### `NotebookSourceLister` Protocol

```python
from typing import Protocol

class NotebookSourceLister(Protocol):
    """Structural source-listing dependency shared across feature APIs."""
    async def list(self, notebook_id: str, *, strict: bool = False) -> list[Source]:
        """List sources for a notebook."""
```

#### `NotebookSourceIdProvider` Protocol

```python
from typing import Protocol

class NotebookSourceIdProvider(Protocol):
    """Structural source-id dependency needed by chat and artifact generation."""
    async def get_source_ids(self, notebook_id: str) -> list[str]:
        """Return source IDs for a notebook."""
```
