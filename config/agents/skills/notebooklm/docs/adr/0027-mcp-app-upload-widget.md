# ADR-0027: In-app MCP-App upload widget (opt-in)

## Status

Accepted (experimental / opt-in).

## Context

ADR-0024 gives remote MCP clients a mobile file-upload path via a signed `/files/ul/<token>`
link the user opens in a browser. It works and is live-validated, but the link itself is a
~250-char opaque token that is fragile through a mobile chat (the short-link indirection
mitigated that). The nicer UX is uploading **without leaving the chat**.

"MCP Apps" (SEP-1865, shipped in claude.ai on 2026-01-26) lets a tool declare a `ui://` HTML
resource that the host renders in a sandboxed iframe with a JSON-RPC-over-postMessage bridge.
That makes an in-app `<input type=file>` possible. Open questions the spike had to settle
on-device: does claude.ai actually render a widget from a plain connector; does the file picker
fire inside the sandbox; can the widget upload cross-origin.

## Decision

Ship an **opt-in** in-app upload widget (`NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_UPLOAD_WIDGET=1`, off by default),
built on the existing ADR-0024 machinery — the widget POSTs bytes to the same `/files/ul` route,
reusing the broker, the in-process completion map, and `await_upload`. No new upload transport.

Rendering in claude.ai needs gates the MCP-Apps spec leaves optional/implicit and FastMCP does
not emit on its own; we add them via FastMCP's `meta=` + `app=` plumbing (verified against the
`primevalsoup/mcp-apps-claude-demo` write-up of ext-apps#671):

- the resource's `_meta.ui.domain = sha256("<public-url>/mcp")[:32] + ".claudemcpcontent.com"`
  (self-computed from the configured public URL — not a host-issued credential);
- the **flat** `_meta["ui/resourceUri"]` on the tool, beside the spec-nested `ui.resourceUri`
  (claude.ai reads the flat one);
- mimeType `text/html;profile=mcp-app` (auto-stamped for `ui://` resources);
- the widget itself sends `ui/notifications/initialized` unconditionally, or the iframe stays
  hidden.

The widget's cross-origin POST needs CORS on `/files/ul`: an `OPTIONS` preflight handler plus
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. `*` is safe here because the signed single-use token is the
sole auth — no cookies/ambient credentials (ADR-0024), so a page that cannot mint a token gains
nothing.

**Opt-in, not default**, because: MCP-Apps is new and host-specific; the render gates are
undocumented and can shift; `ui.domain` is deployment-specific; and it only works on the http
transport with a public URL. So it stays off the default tool surface (and the ADR-0025
tool-count / schema-char budgets) unless a deployment enables it.

## Consequences

- Live-validated end-to-end on Claude Android: widget renders, picker fires in the sandbox, file
  readable, upload lands, source added.
- The `ui.domain` gate is computed per-process from the public URL; a deployment behind a
  different URL than configured will not render (fails closed, silently — the link flow remains).
- CORS on `/files/ul` is now permissive-origin; acceptable given token-only auth.
- **Auto-confirm without a second prompt (#1891).** The upload completes client-side, in a later
  turn, *after* `source_add_widget` has already returned (the host renders the widget from the tool
  result, so the tool cannot block-and-wait) — there is no active model turn when a file lands. So
  the confirmation must be *triggered by the widget*, not the tool. `source_add_widget` returns a
  machine-readable `confirm: {tool: "await_upload", arg: "upload_link", values: upload_urls}`
  contract, and on each successful `/files/ul` POST the widget invokes it host-appropriately —
  `window.openai.callTool` on ChatGPT, a `tools/call` postMessage on claude.ai — passing the link it
  just uploaded to. The host runs `await_upload`, whose result flows to the model as confirmation.
  Purely additive and best-effort: a host that does not run a widget-initiated call simply leaves
  the model on the manual `await_upload` / `source_list` fallback. The exact claude.ai widget→host
  invocation shape is host-specific and undocumented, so it is verified live, not headlessly.
- Follow-ups still deferred: a progress bar and the fallback ladder
  (`window.openai.uploadFile` → direct-PUT → link).
- **Requires stateless HTTP.** An MCP-Apps host reads the `ui://` widget resource on a connection
  without the chat `Mcp-Session-Id`; a stateful FastMCP server rejects that ("Missing session ID"
  → "fail to fetch app content"). Enabling the widget therefore auto-enables
  `FASTMCP_STATELESS_HTTP` (overridable). Stateless is safe for the **single-process** connector —
  every tool is request/response — but two consequences are worth recording:
  - **Single-process invariant (the real constraint — not stateless per se).** The `/files/ul`
    signing key (`FileLinkSigner`) is minted per-process, and `FileLinkSigner.verify` checks each
    upload token's signature against *that* process's key; the in-process completion map that
    `await_upload` reads and `ConsumedJtiStore` (the single-use/replay guard) are likewise
    per-process. Because the file routes carry no session id, a load balancer can't co-locate the
    mint and the POST via MCP session affinity even in *stateful* mode (explicit cookie/IP affinity
    still could) — the hazard is **>1 process** (multiple replicas, or a single replica running
    multiple workers), which stateless only makes tempting. Under multi-process: (a) a `/files/ul`
    POST minted by one process but landing on another **fails signature verification (403) — the
    source is never added**, not merely an `await_upload` confirmation miss; (b) even with a shared
    signing key, `await_upload` would false-negative across processes (`source_list`, an RPC to
    Google that works on any replica, is the source-of-truth backstop) and the single-use guard
    (upload tokens only) degrades to per-process, so a leaked upload token — a content-agnostic
    write primitive — is replayable ~once per process within its TTL, each replay adding one more
    attacker-chosen source (bounded by process count and TTL; a deployment wanting a hard cap needs
    quota controls). To scale out, back the signing key **and** the JTI / completion stores with a
    shared store (e.g. Redis) or pin token minting + `/files/*` + `await_upload` to one replica.
  - **Forecloses server→client MCP features.** Stateless rules out sampling, elicitation, and
    subscriptions / out-of-band notifications (single-request progress notifications still work).
    Each is already covered otherwise — NotebookLM answers with its own grounded model, not the
    client's (no sampling); consent is the `confirm=` two-call pattern (no elicitation) — so the
    only genuine ceiling is **no push-on-generation-complete**: long-running studio work stays on
    the `studio_status` poll.
- **Multi-file via a token pool.** `source_add_widget` mints a small fixed pool of independent
  single-use tokens (`upload_urls`, one per file, cap 10) and the widget uploads file[i] to
  token[i]. This keeps multi-file entirely on the existing single-use `/files/ul` route with no
  change to the completion map, `await_upload`, or this ADR's single-use invariant — unused tokens
  just expire, and minting is stateless (no jti store entry until a token is committed on success).
  The whole pool is minted at one instant but uploaded **sequentially**, so the pool uses a longer
  `WIDGET_UPLOAD_TTL` (1 h) rather than the 15-min single-link `UPLOAD_TTL`: a later token must
  outlive the sum of every earlier file's transfer, or a slow multi-file batch silently 403s a late
  file (#1894). The longer window is a smaller risk class — a pool token is single-use,
  notebook-scoped, and never enters a URL bar / history / `Referer` (it lives only in the widget's
  `structuredContent` / `fetch` body), unlike the human link the tight `UPLOAD_TTL` guards.
- One host resource, the MCP-Apps standard mime `text/html;profile=mcp-app`, serves both claude.ai
  and ChatGPT (a `text/html+skybridge` variant is unnecessary; OpenAI's SDK accepts the standard
  mime). ChatGPT caches the template per conversation, so the first call in a new chat may not
  render (call again) — a client-side quirk, not fixable server-side.
- If a host changes its render requirements, the widget silently stops rendering; the signed-link
  flow (ADR-0024) is the durable fallback and stays the default.
