# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the canonical decisions that shape the `notebooklm-py` codebase. Each record explains _why_ a load-bearing pattern exists so that future contributors don't re-litigate (or silently re-introduce) the trade-off.

## How to use this directory

- Read the relevant ADR before changing the pattern it describes. If you disagree, write a new ADR that supersedes it — do not edit the original past correcting typos.
- Numbering is append-only. Retired ADR numbers are never re-used.
- Filenames follow `NNNN-short-title.md` (lowercase, kebab-case).
- Status values: `Proposed`, `Proposed — <short explanation>`, `Accepted`, `Accepted (retroactive)`, `Accepted (#PR)`, `Accepted (Sunset = <event>)`, `Superseded — <short explanation>`, `Superseded by ADR-NNNN (#PR)`, `Deprecated`, `Rejected`.
- Format: lightweight hybrid — six sections in this exact order: _Title heading_ (`# ADR-NNNN: <Title>`), _Status_, _Context_, _Decision_, _Consequences_, _Alternatives considered_. See [0000-template.md](0000-template.md).

## When an ADR is required

The pull-request template asks contributors to confirm that any change to the _architectural shape_ of the codebase carries an ADR addition or update. "Architectural shape" means any of:

- New / removed / relocated modules in `src/notebooklm/_runtime/`, `src/notebooklm/_middleware/`, `src/notebooklm/auth.py`, `src/notebooklm/_auth/`, `src/notebooklm/cli/services/`.
- Changes to the contracts between layers (CLI ↔ Client ↔ Core ↔ RPC).
- New or retired test patterns (fixtures, monkeypatch policy, conformance tests).
- New cross-cutting policies (retry, idempotency, scrubbing, loop affinity).

Pure bug fixes, additive RPC method IDs, and CLI ergonomics changes do not require an ADR.

### Status Format Legend

The ADR Index table utilizes five eras of Status notation to reflect the lifecycle of decisions:

1. **`Accepted` / `Accepted (retroactive)`** — The decision is currently active and adopted.
2. **`Accepted (Tier X PR Y.Z)`** — Historical PR-naming convention from the early refactoring tiers (Tiers 11-12).
3. **`Superseded — <note>` / `Superseded by ADR-NNNN (#PR)`** — Canonical supersession forms, either with a short inline explanation or a replacing ADR and PR.
4. **`Accepted (#PR)` / `Accepted; <note>` / `Proposed — <note>`** — Short explanatory forms used when a status needs one compact qualifier.
5. **`Superseded by <named-PR> (D1/D2 PR-X)`** — Pre-canonical historical supersession form, linking to specific branch-refactoring PRs.

ADR-0007 ships alongside its enforcement substrate: the concrete fixtures (`tests/_fixtures/`) and meta-lint (`tests/_guardrails/test_no_forbidden_monkeypatches.py`) are added in the same PR (`arch-d1-fixtures-scaffolding`) so the record is grounded in working code rather than an empty placeholder.
