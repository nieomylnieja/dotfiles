# Architecture

This document is the canonical map of `notebooklm-py`'s current runtime shape.
The historical refactor narrative (including the program that first established
this layering) lives in [`docs/refactor-history.md`](./refactor-history.md).

+----------------------------------------------------------+
```

Three thin **transport adapters** fan into that one shared core; everything below
`_app/` is then identical regardless of which adapter drove the call — there is
exactly one client runtime and one RPC stack:

| Adapter | Package | Transport | Console script | Install | Failures render as |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CLI** | `cli/` | terminal (Click) | `notebooklm` | base | exit codes + the byte-stable `--json` error envelope (ADR-0015) |
| **MCP** | `mcp/` | Model Context Protocol (FastMCP) | `notebooklm-mcp` | `mcp` extra · experimental | MCP tool error content (`CODE: message`) |
| **REST** | `server/` | HTTP (FastAPI) | `notebooklm-server` | `server` extra · experimental | HTTP status + `{"error": {"category": "...", "message": "..."}}` |

### Transport-neutral application layer (`_app/`)

The CLI, the MCP server (`mcp/`), and the REST server (`server/`) are each thin
adapters over `src/notebooklm/_app/` — transport-neutral business logic (id
validation/resolution, plan-building, status projection, retry/wait
orchestration, error classification, diagnostics) shared by all three
front-ends. Each adapter parses its transport's inputs into typed
`Request`/`Plan`/`Result` dataclasses, calls the neutral core (which receives the
live client), and renders the typed result into its own envelope vocabulary;
simple reads/mutations call the `client.*` namespaces directly, while multi-step
flows go through the `_app/` cores. The package imports no transport framework —
`click` / `rich` / `fastmcp` / `fastapi`, nor the `cli` / `server` / `rpc`
sibling packages — with the boundary lint-enforced
(`tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py`). It raises only the public
`notebooklm.exceptions` hierarchy, with `_app.errors.classify` as the single
neutral source of the failure-category decision each adapter projects onto its
own codes (CLI exit codes, MCP error shapes, REST HTTP statuses). See ADR-0021.
The per-module index and the full tree are in [File map](#file-map) below.

## Library call flows

`NotebookLMClient` is the composition root. It constructs the shared runtime
collaborator graph, wires feature APIs to narrow runtime Protocols, and
injects stateful services such as `SourceUploadPipeline`, `NoteService`,
`NoteBackedMindMapService`, and `ArtifactDownloadService`. Feature modules
build NotebookLM params and parse domain rows; client-owned collaborators own
dispatch, transport, auth refresh, metrics, and lifecycle.

### Typed batchexecute RPCs

Most public methods (`client.notebooks.list()`, `client.sources.rename()`,
`client.settings.get()`, artifact generation, note CRUD, etc.) follow this path:

```text

| Feature API maps decoded payload -> typed/domain result        |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Production wires `RpcExecutor` directly into each feature as its
`RpcCaller` per ADR-0014 Rule 1; `NotebookLMClient.rpc_call` dispatches
through the same `RpcExecutor` stored as `NotebookLMClient._rpc_executor`
for the public raw-RPC escape hatch.

`NotebookLMClient.rpc_call(method, params)` is the public raw-RPC escape hatch.
It skips feature-specific param builders and result parsers, but still enters
the same `RpcExecutor.rpc_call → RuntimeTransport → Kernel`
pipeline.

### Chat ask path

`ChatAPI.ask()` is the major transport-sharing exception to the pure
`RpcExecutor` shape. Streaming chat has a custom request body and chat-flavored
error mapping, so the first ask POST goes through:

```text
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| ChatAPI.ask(...)                                               |
|   - loop_guard.assert_bound_loop()                             |
|   - source-id lookup                                           |
|   - conversation lock / cache                                  |
|   - reqid.next_reqid()                                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 |
                                 v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| chat_aware_authed_post(transport, ...)                         |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 |
                                 v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post(...)                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 |
                                 v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADR-0009 middleware chain                                      |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 |
                                 v
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| RuntimeTransport.terminal(...) -> Kernel.post                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
                                 |
                                 v  streaming response
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| streaming chat parser + citation/reference parser              |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

`ChatAPI` holds the four collaborators it needs (`rpc`, `transport`,
`reqid`, `loop_guard`) directly — there is no `ChatRuntime` composite
or broad runtime transport indirection.

For a new conversation, `ChatAPI.ask()` then calls `GET_LAST_CONVERSATION_ID`
through the normal `RpcExecutor` path. Other chat methods such as
`get_conversation_turns()` and `delete_conversation()` also use normal
`rpc_call`.

### Uploads, downloads, and polling

Some feature workflows intentionally combine RPC with non-RPC HTTP work:

| Flow | Runtime shape |
|------|---------------|
| Source file upload | `SourcesAPI.add_file()` delegates to `SourceUploadPipeline.add_file()`. The pipeline opens an `operation_scope`, takes its own upload semaphore, registers the file source through `runtime.rpc_call(ADD_SOURCE_FILE)`, then uses a dedicated `httpx.AsyncClient` and live Kernel cookies for the Scotty resumable-upload start/finalize calls. Optional wait/rename steps return to `rpc_call`. |
| Source URL/text/Drive add | `SourceAddService` wraps URL and Drive mutating RPCs in `idempotent_create(...)` because those flows have stable probes. Text-source adds are intentionally non-idempotent unless the caller handles dedupe externally. |
| Artifact generation | `ArtifactsAPI` delegates the `generate_*` / `revise_slide` / `retry_failed` kickoff paths to `ArtifactGenerationService` (`_artifact/generation.py`), which builds `CREATE_ARTIFACT` params (via the `_artifact/payloads.py` builders) and uses the normal `rpc_call` path; the facade keeps thin signature-preserving delegators. `ArtifactPollingService` owns leader/follower polling with `operation_scope(...)` and a feature-local `PollRegistry`; `ArtifactsAPI` registers a close-time drain hook for poll cleanup. |
| Artifact download | `ArtifactDownloadService` lists/selects artifacts through `RpcCaller`, but media downloads use a separate streaming `httpx.AsyncClient` with storage cookies, trusted-host checks, and a producer/writer split. They do not go through `RpcExecutor` or `Kernel.post`. |
| Notes and mind maps | `NoteService` owns note-row CRUD/classification through `RpcCaller`. `NoteBackedMindMapService` adapts those note rows for artifact-facing mind-map behavior so notes and artifacts do not import each other. |

## Cross-cutting policies

Three policies thread through the layers above and are easy to violate by
accident. Each is pinned by an ADR.

### Loop affinity (ADR-0004)

**Why we need it.** The client is built on `httpx.AsyncClient` plus a
network of `asyncio` primitives — locks, semaphores, condition variables,
queues, and a keepalive `Task`. Every one of those binds to the event
loop on which it is first awaited. Re-using a client across loops either
*deadlocks* (the wake-up is scheduled on a loop that will never run
again) or raises a confusing `RuntimeError` from deep inside the
primitive — both fail far away from the actual cause. The contract is
the simplest mitigation that makes the failure mode visible: bind to one
loop and fail loudly on the first violating call instead of hanging ten
minutes later. The cost of cross-loop safety is paid once at the
lifecycle layer instead of in every seam, so individual collaborators
can use plain `asyncio.Lock` / `asyncio.Semaphore` without defensive
re-binding logic.

**The contract.** One `NotebookLMClient` instance is bound to its
`open()`-time event loop. Cross-loop reuse (a different `asyncio.run`,
a different thread's loop) is unsupported and raises `RuntimeError` at
the first authed POST. Cross-thread reuse is unsupported for the same
reason — every thread has its own default loop. Cross-tenant reuse is
unsupported because a live client owns per-instance chat state and auth
state. `ChatAPI._cache` keys on `conversation_id` without an
`account_email` dimension, so tenant-switching a client risks mixing
local chat history if a conversation id is reused across accounts.

The contract is enforced by the free function `assert_bound_loop(...)` in
[`_loop_affinity.py`](../src/notebooklm/_loop_affinity.py), which is
called from every helper that captured a loop reference at `open()` time
(transport drain, reqid counter, auth refresh, artifact polling, chat).
The `LoopGuard` capability Protocol (`assert_bound_loop()`) is how
feature APIs surface the same check without taking a `Session` dependency.

See [ADR-0004](./adr/0004-loop-affinity-contract.md) and the consumer
notes in [`docs/python-api.md`](./python-api.md#concurrency-contract).

### Idempotency (ADR-0005)

**Why we need it.** `batchexecute` runs over HTTPS, so every mutating
call (create, delete, refresh, share, generate, …) is exposed to a
*commit-lost* failure: the server commits the write, then the response
is lost in transit. A naive retry on top of a commit-lost failure
produces a duplicate write — a duplicate notebook, a duplicate source,
an extra LLM inference, a re-sent invite email — depending on the RPC.
The transport's inner retry loop is *correct* for read-only RPCs and
*dangerous* for mutating ones. Before the taxonomy existed, the only
mitigation was a per-call-site `disable_internal_retries=True` flag that
didn't document *why* a given RPC was retry-unsafe, so the decision was
easy to lose during refactors. The taxonomy makes retry safety a
**property of the RPC** (declared once in the registry) instead of a
**property of the call site** (re-derived every time someone touches
the code).

**The classification.** Every active RPC is classified into one of five
retry-safety profiles by the `IdempotencyRegistry` in
[`_idempotency.py`](../src/notebooklm/_idempotency.py):

| Policy | Meaning | Effect on the inner retry loop |
|--------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `UNCLASSIFIED` | Placeholder for hand-built test/future registries; not used by the production registry for active RPCs | Silent, retries enabled (preserves pre-taxonomy behavior) |
| `PROBE_THEN_CREATE` | Caller owns a probe loop; transport must not blind-retry | Force-disable inner retries |
| `IDEMPOTENT_SET_OP` | Replay-safe read-only, delete, rename, or set-state RPC | Retries are safe; left enabled |
| `AT_LEAST_ONCE_ACCEPTED` | Caller has explicitly accepted duplicate side-effect cost (emails / billing / notifications) | Retries enabled; rate-limited WARN emitted so operators can see the trade-off |
| `NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY` | No dedupe key and no probe; first failure must surface | Force-disable inner retries |

The axis is *closed*. A sixth policy would need an ADR update and an
executor change in lockstep — the five-policy cap is intentional so a
reviewer can hold the whole taxonomy in mind during a code review.

`RpcExecutor._execute_once` consults the registry once per call to
resolve the effective `disable_internal_retries`. The caller's explicit
`disable_internal_retries=True` always wins over the registry default.

Every `PROBE_THEN_CREATE` entry must carry a documented `notes`
rationale describing how that mutation recovers (a probe/recovery wrapper
exists) or why inner retries stay disabled. The registry-audit test
`test_retry_disabled_entries_are_intentional_and_documented` fails if a
new `PROBE_THEN_CREATE` policy is added without one.

The production registry has explicit coverage for every active
`RPCMethod`, including read-only RPCs. Read-only entries are registered
as replay-safe `IDEMPOTENT_SET_OP` rows rather than left as
production-`UNCLASSIFIED`; `UNCLASSIFIED` is retained only as a
placeholder for tests and future development.

See [ADR-0005](./adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md). Side-effect probing
(`idempotent_create(...)`) is a separate mechanism not owned by the
registry; see the upload/source-add row in the "Uploads, downloads, and
polling" table above.

### Schema validation (ADR-0011)

Batchexecute responses are undocumented and Google reshapes them without
notice. Decoders walk nested positional lists; a single index shift
either crashes with raw `IndexError` from inside a feature module or
silently degrades.

The single helper that decoders use to navigate row shapes is
`notebooklm.rpc.safe_index` in
[`rpc/_safe_index.py`](../src/notebooklm/rpc/_safe_index.py). It always
raises a typed shape-drift error: strict decoding is the only mode (the
legacy soft-mode opt-out was retired in v0.7.0). The
`RpcExecutor` decode path narrowly wraps
`json.JSONDecodeError`, `KeyError`, `IndexError`, and `TypeError` into
`RPCError`; other exception types (e.g. `AttributeError`) intentionally
propagate as code bugs rather than being conflated with shape drift.

See [ADR-0011](./adr/0011-schema-validation-policy.md).

## Per-capability protocol model

ADR-0013 ("Composable Session Capabilities") is the design rationale:
feature APIs depend on narrow capability Protocols rather than on the
deleted concrete `Session` class.
[ADR-0014](./adr/0014-feature-local-runtime-adapters.md) extends that
intent at runtime: each feature receives the specific collaborator it
needs, never a broad runtime facade. `NotebookLMClient.__init__` is the
composition root that wires each feature with the satisfier it needs.

Three shared Protocols live in
[`_runtime/contracts.py`](../src/notebooklm/_runtime/contracts.py):
`Kernel`, `RpcCaller`, and `LoopGuard`. `RpcCaller` and `LoopGuard`
meet ADR-0013's "shared by at least two features" promotion bar.
`Kernel` remains shared because it is the typed transport surface
implemented by the concrete client-owned kernel and consumed by the
upload pipeline. Single-consumer capabilities stay beside their owner:
`AuthMetadata` lives in `_source/upload.py`, and
`OperationScopeProvider` lives in `_artifact/polling.py`. The unused
`AsyncWorkRuntime` composite and the feature-local composite runtime
Protocols (`ChatRuntime`, `ArtifactsRuntime`, `UploadRuntime`) were
deleted once they no longer represented independently varying
production dependencies.

**Module-level Protocols** (defined in
[`_runtime/contracts.py`](../src/notebooklm/_runtime/contracts.py)):

| Protocol | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| `RpcCaller` | Exposes `rpc_call(method, params, ...)` — the chokepoint every feature API uses for batchexecute calls. |
| `LoopGuard` | Exposes `assert_bound_loop()` — single-method cross-loop affinity check; consumed by anything that may touch the HTTP client. |
| `Kernel` | Pure transport surface — `post()` method, `cookies` property, `aclose()`. Single consumer today: `SourceUploadPipeline`. |

**Feature-module-local Protocols.** Single-consumer capability shapes live
next to their owner (`AuthMetadata` in `_source/upload.py`,
`OperationScopeProvider` in `_artifact/polling.py`). No feature-local
composite-runtime unions or adapter dataclasses exist in production. Every
multi-capability feature takes its collaborators by keyword-only
constructor argument:

- `ArtifactsAPI` and `SourceUploadPipeline` take `rpc: RpcCaller`,
  `drain: TransportDrainTracker`, `lifecycle: ClientLifecycle`.
- `ChatAPI` takes `rpc: RpcCaller`, `transport: RuntimeTransport`,
  `reqid: ReqidCounter`, `loop_guard: LoopGuard`.

Production satisfies shared Protocols via the underlying collaborators
(ADR-0014 Rule 1: `RpcExecutor` satisfies `RpcCaller`,
`ClientLifecycle` satisfies `LoopGuard`, and the concrete `Kernel`
satisfies the `Kernel` Protocol). There is no production `Session`
class in the runtime graph.
Tests substitute
[`tests/_fixtures/fake_core.py:FakeSession`](../tests/_fixtures/fake_core.py)
(constructed via `make_fake_core(...)`) — the sanctioned ADR-0007 / ADR-0013
fixture pattern. `FakeSession` is a backward-compatible test-fixture name,
not a production runtime class. Tests that inject narrow fakes into a
single feature (e.g. `MagicMock(spec=RpcCaller,
rpc_call=AsyncMock(...))`) construct the feature directly under ADR-0014.

### Executor takes its collaborators directly

Per ADR-0014 Rule 5, `RpcExecutor` takes its kernel, transport,
auth-refresh coordinator, and metrics tracker directly — there is no
Session-shaped owner Protocol. The constructor takes
`kernel: Kernel`, `transport: RuntimeTransport`,
`auth_refresh: AuthRefreshCoordinator`, and `metrics: ClientMetrics`
as keyword-only parameters, plus constructor-injected providers for
timeout, refresh-callback enablement, and retry-delay values. The
executor enters transport through
`RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post` directly; the middleware
terminal is `MiddlewareChainHost._authed_post_chain_terminal →
RuntimeTransport.terminal → Kernel.post`. The chain leaf lives on
`MiddlewareChainHost` so the chain owns its own terminal and retry
tunables (ADR-0014 Rule 4 chain-ownership carve-out). Request types,
transport errors, and streaming helpers live in separate owning
modules. This keeps feature APIs on narrow capability Protocols and
the executor on direct collaborator dependencies.

| Collaborator | Module | Responsibility |
|--------------|--------|----------------|
| `NotebookLMClient` | [`client.py`](../src/notebooklm/client.py) | Public surface and composition root. Owns `_auth`, `_seams`, `_composed`, `_collaborators`, `_rpc_executor`, and the eleven feature API attributes (`notebooks`, `sources`, `artifacts`, `chat`, `notes`, `mind_maps`, `research`, `settings`, `sharing`, `labels`, `collections`). `__aenter__`, `close`, `drain`, `is_connected`, `metrics_snapshot`, and `rpc_call` route directly to the owning collaborator. **Split candidate:** at 992 lines it is well below the 1500-line `MODULE_SIZE_BUDGET` ceiling (`tests/_guardrails/test_module_size_ratchet.py`, raised from 1000 on 2026-08-12), so the gate no longer forces the issue. The split guidance stands on its own merits regardless: this module is a composition root, and a non-trivial addition is better placed in a seam than accreted here. Treat that as design judgement, not a line-count trigger. |
| `ClientSeams` | [`_client_seams.py`](../src/notebooklm/_client_seams.py) | Mutable holder for runtime callables that closures re-read after construction: `decode_response`, `sleep`, and `is_auth_error`. Construction-only seams such as `async_client_factory` stay on `compose_client_internals(...)` and the client-shell test helper, not on the public constructor. |
| `ClientComposed` | [`_client_composed.py`](../src/notebooklm/_client_composed.py) | Write-once holder for composition state: `transport`, `executor`, `chain_host`, `chain_builder`, `middlewares`, lazy RPC semaphore, and `runtime_collaborators`. Pre-binding access raises a clear `RuntimeError`; the holder deliberately does not expose a broad `.collaborators` alias. |
| `RpcExecutor` | [`_rpc_executor.py`](../src/notebooklm/_rpc_executor.py) | Single logical batchexecute RPC dispatch path. Owns request-id/started-metric bracketing, idempotency policy lookup, method-ID resolution, request encoding, response decode, RPC error mapping, and decode-time auth refresh retry. Takes its `Kernel`, `RuntimeTransport`, `AuthRefreshCoordinator`, and `ClientMetrics` collaborators directly via keyword-only constructor parameters (ADR-0014 Rule 5). Enters transport through `RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post`. |
| `RuntimeTransport` | [`_runtime/transport.py`](../src/notebooklm/_runtime/transport.py) | Authed POST collaborator. Owns `perform_authed_post()` (loop guard, auth snapshot, request materialization, chain dispatch, queue-wait recording), `refresh_request_for_current_auth()`, and `terminal()` (freshness rebuild + `Kernel.post`). Called directly by `RpcExecutor` and by `chat_aware_authed_post` (ChatAPI's chat-flavoured transport call); the middleware chain leaf at `MiddlewareChainHost._authed_post_chain_terminal` continues to dispatch through `RuntimeTransport.terminal` per ADR-0014 Rule 4. |
| `MiddlewareChainHost` | [`_middleware/chain_host.py`](../src/notebooklm/_middleware/chain_host.py) | Owns the wired middleware chain (`_authed_post_chain`), the chain leaf (`_authed_post_chain_terminal`), the three retry-budget tunables (`_rate_limit_max_retries`, `_server_error_max_retries`, `_refresh_retry_delay`), and the dynamic `await_refresh` delegate that the auth-refresh middleware captures. The chain's provider lambdas and the transport's `chain_provider` closure read the host's attributes live, so post-construction mutation (e.g. tests setting `client._composed.chain_host._rate_limit_max_retries = 0`) still steers the live chain. |
| `AuthRefreshCoordinator` | [`_runtime/auth.py`](../src/notebooklm/_runtime/auth.py) | Owns the auth-snapshot lock and refresh task. Canonical implementation for `AuthRefreshCoordinator.snapshot(auth=...)`, `update_auth_tokens(auth=..., csrf=..., session_id=...)`, and `update_auth_headers(auth=..., kernel=...)`; callers pass explicit collaborators rather than a host object. |
| `ClientLifecycle` | [`_runtime/lifecycle.py`](../src/notebooklm/_runtime/lifecycle.py) | HTTP-client open/close, keepalive task, and typed-versus-legacy cookie-save routing. It alone retains the client-owned `AuthTokens` as the v0.x snapshot mirror and updates that projection after open and accepted saves. Holds `_timeout`, `_bound_loop`, `_http_client`, `_keepalive_*`. |
| `MiddlewareChainBuilder` | [`_middleware/chain.py`](../src/notebooklm/_middleware/chain.py) | Constructs the middleware chain in the canonical ADR-0009 order. |
| `TransportDrainTracker` | [`_transport_drain.py`](../src/notebooklm/_transport_drain.py) | Tracks in-flight transport operations + the drain condition variable. Gates graceful shutdown. |
| `ClientMetrics` | [`_client_metrics.py`](../src/notebooklm/_client_metrics.py) | Per-instance counters (`ClientMetricsSnapshot`) + the `on_rpc_event` user callback. |
| `ReqidCounter` | [`_reqid_counter.py`](../src/notebooklm/_reqid_counter.py) | Monotonic `_reqid` for the chat backend; lock-protected `next_reqid(...)`. |
| `CookiePersistence` | [`_cookie_persistence.py`](../src/notebooklm/_cookie_persistence.py) | Per-canonical-path typed baseline state, ordered `ProfileStore` cookie merges, `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation, and the concrete v0.x snapshot adapter. First-party `_from_store` instances retain no `AuthTokens`; public-constructor instances preserve legacy save compatibility. |
| `IdempotencyRegistry` | [`_idempotency.py`](../src/notebooklm/_idempotency.py) | Policy/classification registry keyed by `(RPCMethod, operation_variant)`. The production registry explicitly covers every active `RPCMethod`; `UNCLASSIFIED` is retained only as a placeholder for hand-built test/future registries. `RpcExecutor._execute_once()` consults it to resolve `effective_disable_internal_retries`. It is part of the RPC dispatch path, not lifecycle state. Side-effect probing (`idempotent_create(...)`) is a separate mechanism not owned by this registry. |
| `_request_types` | [`_request_types.py`](../src/notebooklm/_request_types.py) | Owns `AuthSnapshot`, `BuildRequest`, and request materialization shapes shared by RPC, chat, auth refresh, and the chain terminal. |
| `_transport_errors` | [`_transport_errors.py`](../src/notebooklm/_transport_errors.py) | Owns transport-level exceptions, `Retry-After` parsing, and raw `Kernel.post` error mapping consumed by `RetryMiddleware` and `AuthRefreshMiddleware`. |
| `_streaming_post` | [`_streaming_post.py`](../src/notebooklm/_streaming_post.py) | Low-level streaming POST helper with the response-size cap used by `Kernel.post`. |
| `Kernel` | [`_kernel.py`](../src/notebooklm/_kernel.py) | Pure transport core. Owns the `httpx.AsyncClient` and cookie jar; exposes `post()`, the `cookies` property, and `aclose()` (the close path wraps it in `asyncio.shield` from `ClientLifecycle.close()`). Concrete class behind the `Kernel` Protocol in `_runtime/contracts.py`; constructed by `build_collaborators(...)` and called from the middleware leaf via `RuntimeTransport.terminal → Kernel.post`. |
| `_runtime/init` | [`_runtime/init.py`](../src/notebooklm/_runtime/init.py) | Construction-time helpers for `NotebookLMClient`: `validate_constructor_args` (kwarg validation/normalization), `build_collaborators` (the seven collaborators in dependency order: `metrics`, `drain_tracker`, `reqid`, `auth_coord`, `kernel`, `lifecycle`, `cookie_persistence`), `build_runtime_transport`, `wire_middleware_chain`, and `compose_client_internals`. It binds the runtime graph into `ClientComposed` and returns `ClientInternals(collaborators, executor)`. |
| `_loop_affinity` | [`_loop_affinity.py`](../src/notebooklm/_loop_affinity.py) | Tiny free-function `assert_bound_loop(bound_loop)` shared by every helper that captures a loop reference at `open()` time (`TransportDrainTracker`, `ReqidCounter`, `AuthRefreshCoordinator`, `ArtifactPollingService`, `ChatAPI`). Enforces ADR-0004 without coupling those helpers to the public client. |

### Shipped runtime invariants

[ADR-0016](./adr/0016-auth-identity-and-core-logger-compatibility.md)
pins two compatibility-sensitive details that survive the session-elimination
work:

- `NotebookLMClient._auth` is the authoritative mutable `AuthTokens`
  instance. Refresh paths mutate that object in place, and collaborators that
  observe auth must alias it rather than holding detached copies.
- `CORE_LOGGER_NAME` intentionally remains the literal
  `"notebooklm._core"` even though the `_core.py` compatibility module was
  deleted. Runtime code keeps using this logger key through
  `CORE_LOGGER_NAME` for downstream log filters and `caplog` selectors.
  Treat it as a logging compatibility contract, not evidence that
  `notebooklm._core` is an active module or that a concrete `Session` owner
  remains in the runtime graph.

## Domain-service collaborators

Beyond the client-owned runtime graph, several feature APIs are implemented via dedicated domain services and helper modules:

| Service / Module | Module | Responsibility |
|-------------------|--------|----------------|
| `NoteService` | [`_note_service.py`](../src/notebooklm/_note_service.py) | Service layer managing note CRUD, note-backed content generation, and sync. |
| `NoteBackedMindMapService` | [`_mind_map.py`](../src/notebooklm/_mind_map.py) | Specific adapter service representing mind-maps, backed by standard notebook notes. |
| `ArtifactDownloadService` | [`_artifact/downloads.py`](../src/notebooklm/_artifact/downloads.py) | Asynchronous download coordinator for finished artifacts. |
| `ArtifactGenerationService` | [`_artifact/generation.py`](../src/notebooklm/_artifact/generation.py) | Generation kickoff service (`generate_*`, `revise_slide`, `retry_failed`) extracted from `ArtifactsAPI`. |
| `_artifact_formatters` | [`_artifact/formatters.py`](../src/notebooklm/_artifact/formatters.py) | Markdown, HTML, and plain text formatters for artifacts. |
| `_artifact/listing` | [`_artifact/listing.py`](../src/notebooklm/_artifact/listing.py) | Listing and filtering operations for notebook artifacts. |
| `_row_adapters*` | [`_row_adapters/artifacts.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/artifacts.py), [`_row_adapters/chat.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/chat.py), [`_row_adapters/documents.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/documents.py), [`_row_adapters/labels.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/labels.py), [`_row_adapters/notebooks.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/notebooks.py), [`_row_adapters/notes.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/notes.py), [`_row_adapters/research.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/research.py), [`_row_adapters/sources.py`](../src/notebooklm/_row_adapters/sources.py) | Wire-shape adapters that wrap raw batchexecute rows (`ArtifactRow`, `LabelRow`, `NoteRow`, `SourceRow`, the `POLL_RESEARCH` rows, the `SUGGEST_PROMPTS` suggestion rows) and the streamed-chat rows (`AnswerRow`/`CitationRow`/…) behind named accessors so downloads, polling, listing, labels, research, and the chat parser don't open-code positional indices. Strict decode behavior is pinned in `tests/unit/test_row_adapters.py`, `tests/unit/test_chat_row_adapter.py`, `tests/unit/test_notebooks_row_adapter.py`, `tests/unit/test_research_row_adapter.py`, and `tests/unit/test_citation_alignment.py`. |
| `_research_task_parser` | [`_research_task_parser.py`](../src/notebooklm/_research_task_parser.py) | Parses deep-research task results from raw rows. Returns dict-shaped output today; a typed-model migration is not yet complete. |
| `_types/` | [`_types/`](../src/notebooklm/_types) | Private package holding the dataclass and `Protocol` implementations behind the public `types.py` / per-feature public schemas. Split per domain (`artifacts.py`, `artifact_content.py`, `chat.py`, `documents.py`, `labels.py`, `mind_maps.py`, `notebooks.py`, `notes.py`, `research.py`, `sharing.py`, `sources.py`, plus `common.py` for shared shapes like `ConnectionLimits`). |

## Authentication subpackage

[`auth.py`](../src/notebooklm/auth.py) is a thin public facade that
re-exports the canonical implementations under
[`_auth/`](../src/notebooklm/_auth). ADR-0014 closed ADR-0003's deferred
flat-re-export goal: `AuthTokens` and `load_auth_from_storage()` now live
in `_auth.tokens`, `_validate_required_cookies` is a direct
`_auth.cookie_policy` re-export, and `async def enumerate_accounts` is the
only remaining `auth.py` function body because it binds `_poke_session` as
the default dependency.

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| [`_auth/tokens.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/tokens.py) | `AuthTokens` plus the typed stored-auth application boundary. `StoredAuthLoader` keeps inline/file source, paired seed, final-attempt route, acquisition baseline, initial store merge, and closed `InlineLoadedAuth | FileLoadedAuth` result together. `TokenAcquirer` is its sole structural seam; blocking source/account/merge work is offloaded. The v0.x classmethod and client share the call-time `_load_stored_auth` composition function. |
| [`_auth/paths.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/paths.py) | Storage paths and filesystem helpers, including the **single** derivation behind all four credential lock files (`.lock`, `.rotate.lock`, `.refresh.lock`, `.lock.bootstrap` — the last folded in from `master_token.py` by ADR-0033 PR 1.3, which kept every path byte-identical and every lock mechanism untouched). |
| [`_auth/storage_lock.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/storage_lock.py) | Dependency-bottom `StorageLockManager`: process-default exact-raw-path thread-lock identity, POSIX/Windows OS gateway, bounded synchronous retry, and manager-lifecycle cookie warning claim. Imports stdlib only; `storage`, `profile_store`, and `keepalive` share its process default. |
| [`_auth/credential_io.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/credential_io.py) | Sealed commit capability: the sole unchecked-atomic importer, with distinct private wrappers for complete profile and arbitrary-path master-token documents. |
| [`_auth/master_token_types.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/master_token_types.py) | Dependency-bottom `MasterTokenError`, immutable `MasterToken`, and pure permissive version-1 legacy-record codec. The exception keeps historical `notebooklm._auth.master_token` module/pickle identity; the credential secret is redacted from repr. |
| [`_auth/master_token_file.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/master_token_file.py) | Path-owned one-sample raw/typed master-token reads and canonical writes under the exact dotted sibling lock. Explicit paths remain valid for v0.x adapters; it owns no network/bootstrap policy or cache. |
| [`_auth/mint_service.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/mint_service.py) | Stateless per-attempt master-token exchange and cookie minting, plus the sole raw RotateCookies wire. It depends downward only on `MasterToken` and network libraries; its process-wide mutex only serializes temporary third-party logger levels, and it owns no paths, persistence, storage/domain locks, bootstrap/recovery policy, cache, or retained secrets. |
| [`_auth/master_token_bootstrap.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/master_token_bootstrap.py) | Concrete path-owned bootstrap/re-mint coordinator over exactly one `MintService`, one `ProfileStore`, one bootstrap lock, and one verifier. It owns two-owner advisory checks, session-before-token persistence, strict reload, the four-state missing-storage recheck, and shield-to-settlement cancellation; token I/O routes only through its store. It imports no token file, storage facade, runtime/client, CLI, or recovery owner. |
| [`_auth/cookie_filter.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/cookie_filter.py) | Dependency-bottom raw capture/domain filter plus value-free malformed-row diagnostics. Pure policy/logging: no paths, files, locks, commits, documents, or lifecycle state. |
| [`_auth/profile_store.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/profile_store.py) | Path-owned synchronous document/session reads, derived typed master-token access, blocking cookie transactions, typed in-band account read/update/clear, and typed browser/remint, login/import, and minted-session replacement. Token methods resolve the sibling path at call time and share the store's lock manager. Minted replacement owns the same-lock latest-owner gate, default raw filter, lossless destination preservation/rebind, and one commit. Its repr-hidden request snapshots raw master-token cookie fields (`same_site="None"`) and runtime-permissive email together before path/lock work; it intentionally does not use filtering/SameSite-lossy `CookieJar.from_httpx()`. Owns no cache, baseline, live HTTP jar, legacy scheduler, or network policy. |
| [`_auth/profile_migration.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/profile_migration.py) | Concrete legacy-account ownership plus the path-shaped native login replacement operation: primitive keep/clear/set inputs become dependency-bottom directives, one `ProfileStore`/request/writer composition returns `ReplaceResult`, and post-login reconciliation stays outside the store lock. Also owns lossless two-read resolution, `context.json` read/scrub, only-if-absent embed-before-scrub promotion, and canonical retryable single-flight daemon scheduling with bounded exit drain. It depends downward on `ProfileStore` and account values; no loader, network, runtime, CLI, or token orchestration. |
| [`_auth/storage.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/storage.py) | Shrinking v0.x persistence policy/compatibility facade. Retains raw signatures/results, lock and cookie adapters, the minted live-jar snapshot adapter, and a thin arbitrary-path token writer over `MasterTokenFile`. Remint/login wrappers use exhaustive maps to project native `ReplaceResult`/`CookieMergeResult` statuses into their legacy return types; first-party capture, app, CLI, runtime, and recovery paths consume native results instead. Filter names and transaction functions remain exact compatibility aliases. |
| [`_auth/storage_writer.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/storage_writer.py) | **Shim** — re-exports the writer API from `_auth/storage.py`; defines nothing. Removed at the next major. |
| [`_auth/storage_transaction.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/storage_transaction.py) | **Shim** — re-exports `in_storage_transaction` + the lock-failure policies through `_auth/storage.py`; their definitions live in `_auth/profile_store.py`. Removed at the next major. |
| [`_auth/extraction.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/extraction.py) | Cookie/token extraction from browser sessions. |
| [`_auth/cookies.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/cookies.py) | Cookie maps, `_update_cookie_input`, the network-free pure storage loaders, and thin recovery-composition adapters. Each successfully converted live cookie supplies identity/value/runtime fields while SameSite comes from that same sanitized raw row, preserving first-successful duplicate behavior in the typed baseline. |
| [`_auth/cookie_policy.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/cookie_policy.py) | Domain allowlist, cookie-domain builder (`build_cookie_domain_allowlist`), and cookie policy decisions. |
| [`_auth/cookie_semantics.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/cookie_semantics.py) | Shared cookie-shape and expiry semantics used by sanitized auth loaders and persistence boundaries. |
| [`_auth/cookie_types.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/cookie_types.py) | The canonical `Cookie` / `CookieJar` types (ADR-0031 Stage 1): constructors from every input shape, converters to httpx/storage-state, and the cookie-set policy questions as methods. A delegating wrapper — policy still lives in `cookie_policy`/`cookies`. |
| [`_auth/browser_cookie_recovery.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/browser_cookie_recovery.py) | **Shim** — re-exports `validate` / `heal` / `validate_with_recovery` + `ValidationResult` from `_auth/psidts_recovery.py`; defines nothing. Removed at the next major. |
| [`_auth/browser_state_validation.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/browser_state_validation.py) | **Shim** — re-exports `heal_captured_state` from `_auth/browser_capture.py`; defines nothing. Removed at the next major. |
| [`_auth/browser_capture.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/browser_capture.py) | **One deep module for the browser launch→navigate→capture→filter→heal→persist core** (ADR-0033 sanctioned merge — absorbed `browser_state_validation.py` and `login_wait_trace.py`), lazy `playwright`; shared by the interactive CLI login adapter and the layer-3 headless re-auth layer (ADR-0021). Both capture arms construct `RemintWriteRequest` and consume `ProfileStore.replace_from_remint() -> ReplaceResult` directly. The headless arm classifies the landing URL (authenticated→capture, redirected-to-login→`HeadlessLoginRequiredError`). `run_cdp_capture` is an alternative credential source: attach to an operator-pointed already-running Chrome over CDP (`connect_over_cdp`, disconnect-only teardown) using the SAME landing classification + cookie-domain allowlist. Absorbed sections: (1) **login-wait DEBUG tracing** — `log_observed_navigations` logs each main-frame navigation observed during the five-minute interactive wait at DEBUG so `notebooklm -vv login` is self-diagnosing when a login never lands; inert unless DEBUG is enabled (no listener attached) and it swallows every listener exception, so it can never destabilise the wait. Redaction goes through its own `trace_url`, which keeps **only** scheme + host — deliberately stricter than `extraction._safe_url` (which preserves the path outside a Google-OAuth allowlist), because this traces arbitrary SSO redirects where a federated IdP can carry a one-time assertion in the path. The two redactors are **kept distinct on purpose**. (2) **captured-state heal** — `heal_captured_state`, a best-effort in-memory PSIDTS heal for Playwright-captured state that preserves cookie attributes, returns `(state, error)` and never raises, so a failed heal cannot discard a completed sign-in. `browser_launch_errors.py` stays a separate leaf for cohesion — a channel registry plus a pure classifier, testable without a browser. (It has ONE consumer: the CLI reaches `classify_launch_failure` through this module's re-export, since the CLI-boundary guardrail sanctions only `_auth/browser_capture`.) |
| [`_auth/_browser_cookie_filter.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/_browser_cookie_filter.py) | **Shim** — re-exports the `storage.py` compatibility alias of `cookie_filter.filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy`; defines nothing. Removed at the next major. |
| [`_auth/browser_launch_errors.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/browser_launch_errors.py) | Transport-neutral leaf for `browser_capture`: the `CHANNEL_BROWSERS` channel registry plus `classify_launch_failure`, which maps a Playwright launch failure to actionable help (system browser not installed, bundled Chromium not downloaded, or a Windows `spawn UNKNOWN` execution veto from AppLocker/WDAC/Defender) or to `None` so the original exception propagates. Pure string-in/string-out — no Playwright, no I/O, no CLI. |
| [`_auth/login_wait_trace.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/login_wait_trace.py) | **Shim** — re-exports `log_observed_navigations` / `safe_page_url` / `trace_url` from `_auth/browser_capture.py`; defines nothing. Removed at the next major. |
| [`_auth/headless_reauth.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/headless_reauth.py) | Layer-3 (deepest) auth recovery: when first-party cookies are dead, drive a headless browser against the persistent profile to silently re-mint cookies. Typed honest outcomes (`HeadlessReauthStatus` UNAVAILABLE/FAILED/SUCCESS — never silent `None`). Opt-in only (`refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)` or `NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1`); local-unattended-only, never the remote/MCP auth path. Alternative credential source: `NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL` (or `attempt_headless_reauth(cdp_url=...)`) attaches to an operator-pointed running Chrome instead of the dedicated profile (freshness mitigation). Also exposes `headless_reauth_readiness()` — a credential-free, browser-free probe (profile present + playwright installed) surfaced by `doctor`. |
| [`_auth/recovery.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/recovery.py) | Client-neutral recovery composition and exact paired replacement provenance. A network- and write-free mid-session adapter can reload changed file-backed cookies before external recovery while preserving a concurrently refreshed live jar. One-shot `ColdRecoveryCoordinator` owns the explicit L2.5 → L3 → L4 ladder and scrubs all eleven injected callbacks on every exit. `ColdRecoveryState` owns synchronized weak-loop path locks and success generations; class-owned `_drive_cold`/`_coalesce_cold` are the sole ladder/flight bodies, while the exact-signature legacy functions are thin process-default adapters. |
| [`_auth/single_flight.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/single_flight.py) | `SingleFlight` owns one cross-loop flight registry, strong leader-task set, and per-canonical-path success epochs. A leader task mirrors into a `concurrent.futures.Future`; followers use shielded settle-before-propagate bridging, so waiter cancellation never cancels shared work. Claim plus stale-epoch comparison is atomic, settled slots prompt-pop, and quiescent-only reset refuses live work. Exact module functions remain process-default adapters. |
| [`_auth/account_types.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/account_types.py) | Dependency-neutral immutable `Account` and `PlaywrightAccountRepairResult` values. Both retain historical `notebooklm._auth.account` module/pickle/repr identity. |
| [`_auth/account_repair.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/account_repair.py) | One-operation `AccountRepairService` over six exact collaborators. It claims synchronously before its first await, offloads only cookie loading, performs typed write/clear synchronously, maps only the frozen handled exception set to the legacy result, and scrubs all collaborator references on success, error, cancellation, or an unlisted exception. |
| [`_auth/account.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/account.py) | Account network adapter: probing `?authuser=N`, extracting the active email, formatting the wire value, and composing one `AccountRepairService` with call-time legacy seams. Typed in-band writes live in `ProfileStore`; legacy file policy lives in `_auth/profile_migration.py`; raw compatibility remains in `_auth/storage.py`. |
| [`_auth/account_email.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/account_email.py) | Generation-safe account-email resolution: match persisted identity to the authoritative live cookie route, probe through an injected callback when needed, and self-heal with exact-document CAS without crossing profile-session generations. |
| [`_auth/session.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/session.py) | `refresh_auth_session(auth=..., kernel=..., auth_coord=..., lifecycle=..., cookie_persistence=...)` implementation called by `AuthRefreshCoordinator`. Takes five explicit keyword-only collaborators instead of a Session-shaped owner Protocol; the previous `RefreshAuthCore` Protocol and the `update_auth_tokens` / `update_auth_headers` Session-level forwards have been removed. |
| [`_auth/refresh.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/refresh.py) | Token refresh driver, sole `ColdRecoveryCoordinator` production adapter, and typed `fetch_tokens_with_domains` persistence boundary. `_cold_fallbacks` supplies late-bound L2.5, cold-delegation, route, final-fetch, and jar-replacement closures while preserving exact logs and raw caller / canonical L2.5 / raw caller route timing. L2.5 remains outside the cold single-flight. The domain fetch consumes one paired live/SameSite-preserving baseline sample, carries the selected initial/L2.5/L3/L4 baseline, captures an immutable final observation, and offloads one concrete `ProfileStore` merge. `HARD_FAILURE`, the sole non-advancing result, retains the exact selected baseline; advancing outcomes return the exact next baseline. Caller cancellation during worker offload propagates immediately, without preventing an already-dispatched merge from finishing. The frozen `RefreshDeps` and v0.x compatibility ladder remain. |
| [`_auth/keepalive.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/keepalive.py) | Cookie keepalive and `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation policy. `RotationState` owns per-loop/per-canonical-path locks and monotonic attempt stamps behind one short-held threading lock; claims are stamped before POST, so failure and cancellation consume the 60-second slot. Historical raw state names are non-owning identity views into the process-default owner, and the raw RotateCookies wire remains an exact `mint_service.py` re-export. |
| [`_auth/psidts_recovery.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/psidts_recovery.py) | Inline PSIDTS recovery plus the generic load→validate→heal→retry composition over injected pure loaders. It owns typed raw-document observation/CAS and `ProfileStore` persistence, not cookie-module or storage-facade policy. Sentinel/contended/acquired paths preserve their distinct rereads and narrow caught-error sets; success means the post-save disk state is live, including a sibling winner. Also owns the captured-cookie `validate`/`heal` compatibility seam. |
| [`_auth/master_token.py`](../src/notebooklm/_auth/master_token.py) | Headless master-token compatibility boundary: exchange/mint remain exact v0.x adapters over `MintService`, the raw reader projects one `MasterTokenFile` sample, the writer preserves the call-time `storage.write_master_token` seam, and coarse operations compose `MasterTokenBootstrapper` with late-bound legacy-owner, Android-ID, strict-loader, and verifier bridges. `MasterTokenError` is an identity re-export from the dependency-bottom types leaf. |

The measured persistence boundary is 1,090 lines in `storage.py`, 602 in
`profile_migration.py`, 876 in `profile_store.py`, 96 in `cookie_filter.py`, and 89 in
`master_token_file.py`: 2,753 lines total.
The migration module is internal composition, not a public `ProfileStore` extension surface.
The Phase 9 loader owners remain in `tokens.py` and `refresh.py`. Phase 10 consumes their closed
`FileLoadedAuth` result by registering its exact `ProfileStore`/baseline pair in runtime
`CookiePersistence`, without rereading disk. Direct clients prepare a one-shot disk baseline before
transport; fileless clients capture only the live compatibility projection. A missing saver always
uses ordered typed merges; only an explicit `cookie_saver=` retains the v0.x callback surface and
its per-key adapter snapshot. `ClientLifecycle` owns the sole
`AuthTokens.cookie_snapshot` mirror. Measured Phase 10 owners are 457 lines in
`_cookie_persistence.py`, 618 in `_runtime/init.py`, 628 in `_runtime/lifecycle.py`, and 992 in
`client.py`.

Phase 12C completes state ownership without changing the public ladder or on-disk schema. The
measured auth graph is **40 modules / 15,237 lines / 128 unique edges (117 module + 11
function-local)**; both the module-only and all-scope SCC sets are empty. The former
`cookies/master_token/psidts_recovery/storage` all-scope cycle is gone. Final touched owner sizes
are pinned by the module ratchet; `storage.py` and `refresh.py` shrink, and no bottom owner imports
the facade. Public storage/auth savers, `Account`/repair-result/`MasterTokenError` identities,
module adapters, keepalive raw-state identity views, and client/runtime injection seams remain
v0.x compatible.

The cookie lifecycle — what gets written, who rotates, what the
keepalive contract is — is documented separately in
[`docs/auth-cookie-lifecycle.md`](./auth-cookie-lifecycle.md). Credential authority, cancellation,
retention, and compatibility threats are summarized in [`docs/security.md`](./security.md).

## CLI layer (ADR-0008)

The CLI is intentionally a thin adapter over the public Python client.
It does not build raw batchexecute payloads, import the RPC layer, or
reach into private `notebooklm._*` implementation modules. Click
commands in
[`src/notebooklm/cli/*_cmd.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli) own argument
parsing, user-visible rendering, JSON envelopes, and exit codes;
workflow logic lives in
[`src/notebooklm/cli/services/`](../src/notebooklm/cli/services). This
separation is the [ADR-0008](./adr/0008-cli-services-extraction-pattern.md)
extraction pattern.

The console-script entry point is
[`notebooklm_cli.py`](../src/notebooklm/notebooklm_cli.py). It declares
the root `notebooklm` Click group with
[`SectionedGroup`](../src/notebooklm/cli/grouped.py), owns process-wide
options (`--storage`, `--profile`, `--verbose`, `--quiet`),
canonicalizes the storage path into `ctx.obj`, stores the selected
profile/quiet values there, and registers the top-level commands plus
command groups. `SectionedGroup` is a presentation concern only: it
bins commands in help output, and
[`tests/unit/cli/test_grouped.py`](../tests/unit/cli/test_grouped.py)
rejects new unbinned commands.

A typical authenticated command follows this path:

```text

+----------------------------------------------------------------+
```

| Layer | Owns | Does NOT own |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `notebooklm_cli.py` | Root Click group, global options, profile/storage setup, command registration | Per-command workflows, rendering of command results |
| `cli/*_cmd.py` | Click decorators, option parsing, stdout/stderr rendering, JSON output, exit codes | Business logic, RPC dispatch, retry loops |
| `cli/services/*.py` | Workflow orchestration, plan dataclasses, result types, retry/wait policy | Click context, `console.print`, `SystemExit` (target end-state; some modules are still mid-migration) |

Command modules are named `*_cmd.py` (e.g. `source_cmd.py`,
`notebook_cmd.py`) to avoid Python's package-attribute shadowing — the
historical short names (`source`, `notebook`, …) are re-exported from
`cli/__init__.py` so existing imports keep working. The shadowing
invariant is pinned by `tests/_guardrails/test_no_module_shadowing.py`.

CLI services are organised by feature family; notable examples include
`cli/services/login/` (browser-profile enumeration split across Chromium
and Firefox cookie jars), `cli/services/source_*` (URL/file/research
source flows), and `cli/services/generate.py`. The CLI
service-layer boundary is guarded by
[`tests/unit/cli/test_services_boundary.py`](../tests/unit/cli/test_services_boundary.py):
new service modules must either be fully cleaned of Click/rendering/exit
ownership or be added to the explicit transitional inventory with the
current violations and rationale.

The cross-command helpers form a small internal CLI stack:

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| [`cli/runtime.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/runtime.py) | Leaf runtime helpers: root `--quiet` lookup and the single `asyncio.run(...)` bridge for sync Click handlers. |
| [`cli/auth_runtime.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/auth_runtime.py) | Shared auth bootstrap, command-body error wrapping, and optional opened-client workflow helper. |
| [`cli/master_token_login.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/master_token_login.py) | Command driver for `notebooklm login --master-token[-refresh]`: resolves paths and renders the outcome over the public `master_token_bootstrap` / `master_token_remint` / `assert_account_writable` adapters. Coordination lives in `_auth/master_token_bootstrap.py`; only interactive browser `oauth_token` capture ([`cli/services/login/master_token.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/services/login/master_token.py)) stays CLI-side (ADR-0023/ADR-0034). |
| [`cli/services/auth_refresh.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/services/auth_refresh.py) | Pure re-export of `notebooklm.auth.bootstrap_missing_storage_from_master_token` for `auth refresh`'s missing-storage preflight. `_auth/master_token_bootstrap.py` owns the four-state machine; `_auth/master_token.py` owns the v0.x enum-to-bool collapse. |
| [`cli/services/auth_source.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/services/auth_source.py) | Single resolver for CLI auth-source precedence (`--storage`, `NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`, active profile). |
| [`cli/context.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/context.py) | Profile/storage-scoped `context.json` persistence for active notebook and conversation state. Account metadata now lives unified in-band in `storage_state.json` (`_auth/storage.py`); `context.json` is only its pre-v0.5.0 legacy source, promoted in-band on read and no longer written here (#2103 PR-0). |
| [`cli/resolve.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/resolve.py) | Notebook/source/artifact/note ID resolution, including partial-ID matching against public client list calls. |
| [`cli/options.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/options.py) + [`cli/completion.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/completion.py) | Shared Click option decorators and best-effort shell completion. Completion providers may load auth and list public client resources, but swallow all failures so shells never print diagnostics during TAB completion. |
| [`cli/rendering.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/rendering.py) | Rich/text/JSON rendering helpers. Status lines in JSON mode go to stderr so stdout remains parseable JSON. |
| [`cli/error_handler.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/error_handler.py) | Canonical CLI error-to-exit mapping. Under `--json`, command-body failures use the typed error envelope from [ADR-0015](./adr/0015-json-envelope-contract-for-post-parse-click-exceptions.md). Parse-time Click parser errors remain Click-owned. |
| [`cli/helpers.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/helpers.py) | Backward-compatible facade for historical imports and test patch targets. New production code should import from the owning helper module instead. |

The boundary is enforced statically by
[`tests/_guardrails/test_cli_boundary.py`](../tests/_guardrails/test_cli_boundary.py):
CLI modules may import public `notebooklm` modules and their own
intra-CLI private helpers, but not `notebooklm._*`, `notebooklm.rpc.*`,
or private names from public modules. **Two sanctioned exceptions** to the
`notebooklm._*` rule are whitelisted in that gate: `notebooklm._app`
(the transport-neutral business-logic layer every adapter consumes) and the
single module `notebooklm._auth.browser_capture` (the transport-neutral
browser launch→capture→filter→persist core that the Playwright login adapter
[`cli/services/playwright_login.py`](../src/notebooklm/cli/services/playwright_login.py)
sits over, per ADR-0021 — interactive presentation stays in `cli/` while the
neutral core moves down to `_auth`, reachable by the client runtime and the
future headless re-auth layer). No other `_auth.*` module may be imported by
the CLI — the rest stays behind the `auth.py` facade. The same test keeps
low-level helpers (`runtime`, `context`, `resolve`, `rendering`,
`auth_runtime`, `options`) from growing upward dependencies on command modules
or the `cli.helpers` compatibility facade.

## MCP adapter (`mcp/`)

The MCP server is a second thin adapter beside `cli/`, opt-in behind the `mcp`
extra and **experimental** (preview). `create_server()` builds a FastMCP server
that exposes the `_app/` cores as MCP tools driving a single long-lived
`NotebookLMClient`; run it with the `notebooklm-mcp` console script (stdio or
loopback HTTP). It imports no `click` / `rich` / `cli` — like the CLI, it is built
on the `_app/` cores only (enforced by `tests/_guardrails/test_mcp_boundary.py`).
Failures surface as `CODE: message` strings projected from `_app.errors.classify`,
and mutating tools are confirmation-gated (they return a `needs_confirmation`
preview unless called with `confirm=true`). `notebooklm mcp install <client>`
wires it into Claude Desktop/Code, Cursor, or Windsurf, and `desktop-extension/`
packages a one-click `.mcpb` bundle. Full guide:
[`docs/mcp-guide.md`](./mcp-guide.md).

## REST server (`server/`)

The single-tenant REST server is the third adapter (ADR-0021), opt-in behind the
`server` extra and **experimental**. A FastAPI app maps `/v1` routes onto the
`_app/` cores and the public client namespaces, with one `NotebookLMClient` opened
once at the ASGI lifespan inside the server loop (honoring the ADR-0004 loop-
affinity contract). Every `/v1` request requires a static bearer token
(constant-time compare) plus a loopback `Host` literal (a DNS-rebinding guard);
`/healthz` is the one public route, and the `/docs` / `/openapi.json` schema
surface is disabled. Long-running work (source ingest, artifact generation) uses
the **poll-the-resource** model — the create call returns immediately and the
matching `GET` reports `pending` / `200` / `404` / `409` / `410`. Failures project
from `_app.errors.classify` onto an HTTP status plus the
`{"error": {"category": "...", "message": "..."}}` envelope. It imports no `click` / `rich` /
`cli` (enforced by `tests/_guardrails/test_server_boundary.py`). Launch and
configuration: [`docs/installation.md`](./installation.md#rest-api-server).
Expensive route groups have lifespan-owned concurrency limiters, tuned by
`NOTEBOOKLM_SERVER_*_CONCURRENCY` env vars, so source mutation/wait, artifact
generation/download, research, and blocking chat work cannot unboundedly starve
cheap reads or `/healthz`.

## Middleware chain (ADR-0009)

The runtime chain order is pinned by
[`tests/unit/test_chain_wiring.py`](../tests/unit/test_chain_wiring.py)
(facade-level) and
[`tests/unit/test_middleware_chain_builder.py`](../tests/unit/test_middleware_chain_builder.py)
(builder-level). The order is load-bearing: changing it without
simultaneously updating the pin tests
(`test_chain_seeded_with_final_adr_009_ordering`) is a bug.

The chain list in [`MiddlewareChainBuilder.build()`](../src/notebooklm/_middleware/chain.py)
reads outermost-first (index 0 wraps everything below it):

```text
DrainMiddleware              outermost — admits and tracks for shutdown drain
   ↓
MetricsMiddleware            starts timing here (latency includes queue wait)
   ↓
SemaphoreMiddleware          max_concurrent_rpcs slot acquired AFTER Drain/Metrics,
                             BEFORE Retry can re-enter (one slot per logical RPC)
   ↓
RetryMiddleware              429 / 5xx with Retry-After honor
   ↓
AuthRefreshMiddleware        refresh-on-auth-error; capped retries
   ↓
ErrorInjectionMiddleware     synthetic-error harness; no-op in prod
   ↓
TracingMiddleware            innermost — structured-logging boundary
                             (OpenTelemetry export is future work)
   ↓
Authed POST leaf             (RuntimeTransport.terminal → Kernel → httpx)
```

## Client as composition root

`NotebookLMClient` is both the public surface and the composition root. It owns
`ClientComposed`, the collaborator bundle, the RPC executor, and the feature API
instances. `ClientLifecycle` owns open/close behavior (loop-affinity binding,
keepalive task, cookie persistence, and transport teardown);
`TransportDrainTracker` owns drain semantics.

Concretely, the client-owned runtime retains:

1. **Late-bound composition slots.** `ClientComposed.transport`, the chain
   metadata slots (`chain_builder` / `middlewares`), and
   `ClientComposed.executor` are bound exactly once by
   `compose_client_internals(...)` through write-once binders. Pre-binding
   access trips the `ClientComposed` guard. `ClientComposed` exposes
   `runtime_collaborators`, not a broad `collaborators` alias.
   [`tests/_guardrails/test_client_composition.py`](../tests/_guardrails/test_client_composition.py)
   guards against inlining holder state back onto `NotebookLMClient`.
2. **Middleware-chain seams.** The chain leaf
   (`_authed_post_chain_terminal`), the chain slot (`_authed_post_chain`),
   the dynamic refresh delegate (`await_refresh`), and the three
   retry-budget tunables (`_rate_limit_max_retries`,
   `_server_error_max_retries`, `_refresh_retry_delay`) live on
   `MiddlewareChainHost`. `wire_middleware_chain` and
   `build_runtime_transport` take that host directly and read its
   attributes live.
3. **Lifecycle methods.** Public client `__aenter__`, `__aexit__`,
   `close`, `drain`, and `is_connected` call `ClientLifecycle` and
   `TransportDrainTracker` directly.

`NotebookLMClient.rpc_call(method, params)` dispatches directly through
`self._rpc_executor.rpc_call(...)` — the `RpcExecutor` captured during
the shared `_client_assembly.py::_assemble_client(...)` construction path
from `compose_client_internals(...)` and shared with every feature API.

Feature APIs receive the collaborator they need (`RpcExecutor` for
`RpcCaller`, `ClientLifecycle` for `LoopGuard`, the concrete `Kernel`
for upload cookies/posting, and `TransportDrainTracker` for local
operation scopes / close hooks) per ADR-0014 Rules 1 + 3. Features that
need more than one capability — `ChatAPI`, `ArtifactsAPI`, and
`SourceUploadPipeline` — take each collaborator by keyword-only
constructor argument. The composition wiring is centralized in
[`_client_assembly.py`](../src/notebooklm/_client_assembly.py), which is
called by both `NotebookLMClient.__init__` and the canonical test
factory.

## Testing patterns

Two policies define how tests interact with the architecture above.

### Constructor-injection fixtures (ADR-0007)

The forbidden patterns are `monkeypatch.setattr("notebooklm.…")` against
module-level seams and direct attribute assignment like
`target.rpc_call = AsyncMock(...)`. The sanctioned substitute is
[`tests/_fixtures/fake_core.py:make_fake_core(...)`](../tests/_fixtures/fake_core.py),
which returns a `FakeSession` configured to satisfy the narrow
shared protocols plus the upload/polling local protocols used by legacy
feature tests. The name is backward-compatible test vocabulary; it is
not a production `Session` replacement. Multi-capability features
(`ChatAPI`, `ArtifactsAPI`, `SourceUploadPipeline`) take their direct
collaborators by keyword-only constructor argument, so unit tests can inject narrow
`MagicMock(spec=RpcCaller, rpc_call=AsyncMock(...))`-style fakes
directly via those constructors.

The meta-lint at `tests/_guardrails/test_no_forbidden_monkeypatches.py`
enforces the policy; the file-level allowlist shrinks as legacy tests
migrate. See [ADR-0007](./adr/0007-test-monkeypatch-policy.md).

### Test suite taxonomy

- **Unit tests** (`tests/unit/`): No network, decode/encode only.
- **Integration tests** (`tests/integration/`): Mock HTTP responses or
  use VCR cassettes scrubbed per
  [ADR-0006](./adr/0006-vcr-scrubber-strategy.md).
- **E2E tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Real API; require auth; marked
  `@pytest.mark.e2e` and excluded from the default run.

Pin tests that lock architectural invariants (chain ordering, narrow
Protocol membership, no forbidden monkeypatch) live in `tests/unit/`
and `tests/_guardrails/` — changing the underlying invariant without updating
the pin is a bug.

A fuller taxonomy can be generated with
[`scripts/test_taxonomy_inventory.py`](../scripts/test_taxonomy_inventory.py).

## Implementation surface convention (ADR-0012)

`notebooklm-py` keeps a small set of public-named modules (`artifacts.py`,
`auth.py`, `client.py`, `config.py`, `exceptions.py`, `io.py`, `log.py`,
`migration.py`, `notebooklm_cli.py`, `paths.py`, `research.py`,
`types.py`, `urls.py`, `utils.py`) and routes everything else through
underscore-prefixed seam modules. Anything underscored is *not* a
supported import surface; it can be moved, renamed, or deleted without a
deprecation cycle. See [ADR-0012](./adr/0012-implementation-surface-convention.md).

The corollary for contributors: if you find yourself reaching into
`notebooklm._foo`, prefer a capability Protocol or a public function in
one of the named modules.

## Boundary moratorium

New architectural carve-outs are expensive: every ADR amendment and
`tests/_guardrails/` pin becomes load-bearing for contributors who have
to read the docs before touching the relevant seam. To keep that
surface from drifting upward without bound, the following discipline
applies to any future change that would *expand* the documented
boundary set:

- **Justify by failure mode.** A new ADR amendment or `tests/_guardrails/` pin
  must cite a concrete user-visible failure mode
  it prevents (loop-affinity break, auth-snapshot tear, transport drain
  regression, public-API breakage, etc.). "Future-proofing" or "in case
  someone refactors X" is not sufficient.
- **Prefer deletion over carve-out.** When a compatibility seam can be
  removed instead of documented, remove it. Carve-outs are the fallback
  when removal is genuinely infeasible, not the default.
- **One owner per rule.** A pin without a corresponding ADR clause (and
  vice versa) is a smell — it means the rule is enforced but not
  explained, or explained but not enforced.

The intent is architectural: shrink the boundary set whenever the
underlying code allows it, and resist growing it on speculative grounds.

## Glossary

Vocabulary that recurs in this document and the surrounding code.

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `batchexecute` | Google's internal RPC protocol over HTTPS. The wire is positional lists keyed by an obfuscated method id; see [`rpc/types.py`](../src/notebooklm/rpc/types.py). |
| Capability Protocol | A narrow structural `Protocol` (e.g. `RpcCaller`, `LoopGuard`) a feature depends on instead of taking the deleted concrete `Session` class or a broad runtime facade. See [ADR-0013](./adr/0013-composable-session-capabilities.md). |
| Chain / leaf / terminal | The middleware chain's ordering vocabulary. The chain wraps outermost-first; the **leaf** is the innermost middleware (`TracingMiddleware`); the **terminal** is the authed-POST function (`RuntimeTransport.terminal → Kernel.post`) that ends the chain. |
| Drain | Graceful-shutdown waiting on in-flight transport operations to complete. Owned by `TransportDrainTracker` and admitted by `DrainMiddleware`. |
| `idempotent_create(...)` | Caller-owned probe-then-create wrapper used by source-add / Drive-add flows. Distinct from the `IdempotencyRegistry` (which only classifies retry safety inside the executor). |
| `operation_variant` | Optional kwarg on `rpc_call(...)` that selects a method-variant-specific idempotency policy from the registry (e.g. `ADD_SOURCE` `"url"` vs `"drive"`). Unknown variants raise `IdempotencyVariantError`. |
| RPC method id | A short obfuscated identifier (`rpcids=`) Google uses to route batchexecute calls. Source of truth: `RPCMethod` enum in `rpc/types.py`. |
| Snapshot | An `AuthSnapshot` (see [`_request_types.py`](../src/notebooklm/_request_types.py)) — an immutable, point-in-time view of session id, CSRF token, authuser, and account email. Taken inside the auth-snapshot lock so a refresh racing with a transport build cannot tear. |

## File map

Per-file index plus the full `src/notebooklm` + `tests` repository tree. The tree is the hand-maintained module map that [`scripts/check_claude_md_freshness.py`](../scripts/check_claude_md_freshness.py) checks in both directions (documented paths exist; every module is documented or intentionally omitted).

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `client.py` | Main `NotebookLMClient` class |
| `_client_assembly.py` | Single private assembly seam (`_assemble_client`) that wires every constructor-set attribute; shared by `NotebookLMClient.__init__` and the canonical test factory (`tests/_helpers/client_factory.py`) so the two construction paths cannot drift. |
| `_client_composed.py` | Client-owned composition holder for transport, executor, chain host, middleware metadata, and runtime collaborator bundle. |
| `_client_seams.py` | Constructor-only injectable seams used by tests and collaborator construction. |
| `_runtime/init.py` | Constructor helpers that validate client runtime kwargs, build collaborators (returning a `RuntimeCollaborators` bundle), wire middleware, and bind `ClientComposed`. |
| `_kernel.py` | Concrete `Kernel` transport core (owns `httpx.AsyncClient` + cookie jar) |
| `_runtime/config.py` | `DEFAULT_*` knobs and module-level constants. `CORE_LOGGER_NAME = "notebooklm._core"` is intentionally preserved as a compatibility logging contract even though the `_core` module was deleted; renaming it silently breaks downstream `caplog`/logger filters. |
| `_env.py`, `config.py` | Runtime environment defaults and the public config re-export surface |
| `_logging.py`, `log.py` | Redaction/correlation logging internals and the public logging helper surface |
| `_secrets.py` | Canonical runtime registry of must-scrub bare session-cookie names (`RUNTIME_SESSION_COOKIES`), `__Secure-*` / `__Host-*` prefix umbrellas (`SECURE_HOST_UMBRELLA_PATTERNS`, fail-closed for future names), and carrier-agnostic Google credential shapes (`AUTH_TOKEN_SHAPE_PATTERNS` — `g.a000-` / `sidts-` / `ya29.` tokens + the `AIza…` API key) that `_logging.py` redaction and `exceptions.py` scrubbing DERIVE from. Runtime code cannot import from `tests/`, so this restates the cassette sanitizer's must-scrub shapes; `tests/_guardrails/test_runtime_secret_registry_parity.py` asserts lockstep with `tests/cassette_patterns.py` on every axis — bare-cookie superset, umbrella coverage, and regex-string shape equality (issues #1517/#1518). |
| `_callbacks.py` | Sync-or-async callback invocation helper used by telemetry/retry hooks |
| `_lookup.py` | `unwrap_or_raise(obj, exc)` — the shared single-row-lookup helper backing the public `get`/`get_or_none` pair (ADR-0019 Enforcement tier-2). The four `sources`/`artifacts`/`notes`/`mind_maps` `get()` methods call it directly to raise their `*NotFoundError` on a miss (the v0.8.0 flip, issue #1247); `notebooks.get()` already raised on its own path and does not route through it. |
| `_loop_bound.py` | `LoopBoundPrimitive` — template-method base for the loop-affinity `set_bound_loop` protocol. Owns the `_bound_loop` field + a `set_bound_loop` that always stores the binding and fires the `_on_loop_rebind(old, new)` hook only on a real loop change (hook before store). Trivial owners (`TransportDrainTracker`/`ReqidCounter`/`AuthRefreshCoordinator`) use the default no-op hook; clear-on-rebind owners (`ClientComposed`/`SourceUploadPipeline`/`ChatAPI`) override it to discard their cached loop-bound primitive/locks. Owns only the binding + rebind hook — the cross-loop *assert* stays in `_loop_affinity`, and each owner keeps its own `reset_after_open`. |
| `_deprecation.py` | Deprecation helper, gated by `NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS`. The immutable `DEPRECATION_SPECS` table owns the two Phase 13D auth-storage messages, replacements, since/removal versions, categories, and public-boundary stacklevels; `warn_registered_deprecation` emits them through `warn_deprecated`. `scripts/check_deprecation_targets.py` parses the table and callsites without importing application code and fails closed on malformed, missing, stale, lapsed, or structurally unresolved entries. Unrelated one-off deprecations continue to use `warn_deprecated`; `deprecations_quiet` / `_deprecations_quiet` / `_QUIET_ENV_VAR` retain the live suppression gate. ADR-0018 forbids inline `warnings.warn(..., DeprecationWarning)` outside this module — `tests/_guardrails/test_no_inline_deprecation_warnings.py` enforces it (only for `DeprecationWarning`; inline `RuntimeWarning`/`UserWarning` remains allowed). The permanent `save_cookies_to_storage(original_snapshot=None)` race advisory is therefore still an ungated `RuntimeWarning`. See `docs/deprecations.md`. |
| `_runtime/helpers.py` | `is_auth_error`, `AUTH_ERROR_PATTERNS`, `_resolve_keepalive_interval` |
| `_error_injection.py` | Synthetic-error env-var resolver + startup guard |
| `_client_metrics.py` | `ClientMetrics` — `ClientMetricsSnapshot` counters + `on_rpc_event` callback |
| `_transport_drain.py` | `TransportDrainTracker` — in-flight transport counters + `_TransportOperationToken` |
| `_deadline.py` | `RuntimeDeadline` helper shared by retry and polling loops so aggregate timeouts clamp sleep consistently |
| `_backoff.py` | Shared capped exponential-backoff calculation with deterministic test injection |
| `_reqid_counter.py` | `ReqidCounter` — monotonic `_reqid` for the chat backend |
| `_runtime/auth.py` | `AuthRefreshCoordinator` — refresh task + auth-snapshot lock |
| `_auth_refresh_retry.py` | Shared auth refresh-and-retry core for the two retry layers (HTTP-status `AuthRefreshMiddleware` + decoded-RPC `RpcExecutor`): the once-per-logical-call `RefreshBudget` token and the common `refresh_and_count` body (log/refresh/sleep/`rpc_auth_retries` metric). Unifies the previously-divergent copies per issue #1205; the two layers keep their distinct triggers and refresh-failure exception shapes. |
| `_runtime/lifecycle.py` | `ClientLifecycle` — loop-affinity guard + keepalive task |
| `_runtime/transport.py` | `RuntimeTransport` — authed-POST transport wrapper that drives the middleware chain and typed transport response handling |
| `_rpc_executor.py` | RPC dispatch executor. Takes its `Kernel`, `RuntimeTransport`, `AuthRefreshCoordinator`, and `ClientMetrics` collaborators directly via keyword-only constructor parameters (ADR-0014 Rule 5). Defines a single local `DecodeResponse` Protocol. |
| `_request_types.py` | Shared authed POST request construction types: `AuthSnapshot`, `BuildRequest`, `PostBody`, and materialization helpers. |
| `_transport_errors.py` | Transport exceptions, `Retry-After` parsing, and terminal `Kernel.post` error mapping for retry/auth middleware. |
| `_streaming_post.py` | Size-capped streaming POST helper used by `Kernel.post`. |
| `_middleware/core.py` | HTTP-shaped middleware request/response envelope, chain composition, and middleware Protocol |
| `_middleware/context.py` | Canonical per-request context-key vocabulary for middleware |
| `_middleware/chain_host.py` | Mutable owner for the live middleware chain slots and retry-budget tunables |
| `_conversation_cache.py` | Per-instance true-LRU conversation cache for `ChatAPI` (caps conversation count via `MAX_CONVERSATION_CACHE_SIZE` and per-conversation turns via `MAX_TURNS_PER_CONVERSATION`) |
| `_polling_registry.py` | Pending-poll registry for long-running artifact generations |
| `_cookie_persistence.py` | Cookie-jar persistence + `__Secure-1PSIDTS` rotation |
| `_runtime/contracts.py` | Shared runtime Protocols consumed by sub-clients |
| `_idempotency.py` | Mutating-RPC idempotency policy registry and probe-then-retry wrapper; ADR-0005 is the taxonomy source |
| `_idempotency_policy.py` | Declarative per-RPC idempotency classification data, applied to `IDEMPOTENCY_REGISTRY` via `register_default_policies` at `_idempotency` import time (#1331). Holds the load-bearing two-pass seeding order (pre-seed `register()` → `_seed_defaults()` → post-seed `register()` + the read/set-op loop). |
| `_atomic_io.py`, `io.py` | Atomic JSON write/update internals and public I/O re-export surface for CLI boundary compliance |
| `exceptions.py` | Public exception hierarchy plus safe diagnostic preview/redaction helpers |
| `paths.py`, `migration.py` | Profile-aware path resolution and locked migration from the legacy flat layout |
| `_types/`, `types.py` | Dataclass implementation package and public type/re-export facade |
| `_types/documents.py` | `StructuredDocument` / `DocumentBlock` / `TextSpan` / `TableCell` / `DocumentAnnotation` / `BlockKind` / `BlockStyle` / `ListStyle` / `ListInfo` — the transport-neutral parsed-document types behind `SourceFulltext.document` and `AskResult.answer_document`, carrying the character offsets citations anchor to (#2128, #2120). `StructuredDocument.render()` derives the readable flat rendering (`SourceFulltext.rendered_content`) from the same tree, and is what `utils.resolve_chat_reference_passage` returns once it has resolved a citation by offset (#2211); `DocumentBlock.table_rows` carries the table cell ranges that rendering separates on, as offsets, so the coordinate space is untouched (#2230) |
| `_types/labels.py` | `Label` pure-value type (source-label topic grouping; `source_ids` only, no artifact members) re-exported by `types.py` |
| `_types/collections.py` | `Collection` pure-value type (account-level notebook grouping; `notebook_ids`, no notebook parent) re-exported by `types.py`; decodes positionally (its own strict descent, not `LabelRow` — populated members are bare notebook-id strings, not `LabelRow`'s wrapped-singleton source ids) |
| `_row_adapters/artifacts.py` | `ArtifactRow` typed view over raw positional artifact RPC rows, plus `ReportSuggestionRow` over `GET_SUGGESTED_REPORTS` rows |
| `_row_adapters/chat.py` | Streamed-chat row adapters (`AnswerRow` / `CitationRow` / `CitationDetail` / `StreamFrameRow` / `ErrorPayloadRow`) that centralise the chat wire positions `_chat/wire.py` used to open-code (#1491). `AnswerRow.document` and `CitationDetail.fragment_elements` delegate the document tree to `_row_adapters/documents.py` (#2120) |
| `_row_adapters/documents.py` | `TailwindDoc` tree adapters (`DocumentBodyRow` / `StructuralElementRow` / `ParagraphRow` / `ParagraphElementRow` / `TextRunRow` / `TableRow` / `BulletInfoRow` / `AnnotationEntryRow`) plus the `build_document` / `build_blocks` builders. One decoder for all three carriers of the tree — source fulltext, chat-answer `responseDoc`, and a citation's `TailwindDocFragment` — so citation offsets on both sides share a coordinate space (#2128, #2120) |
| `_row_adapters/labels.py` | `LabelRow` strict typed view over the raw positional label tuple `[name, sources, id, emoji]` (fails loud on schema drift) |
| `_row_adapters/notebooks.py` | `SUGGEST_PROMPTS` (`otmP3b`) suggestion-row view (`PromptSuggestionRow` / `unwrap_prompt_suggestions`) backing `NotebooksAPI.suggest_prompts` |
| `_row_adapters/notes.py` | `NoteRow` typed view over raw positional note and mind-map RPC rows |
| `_row_adapters/research.py` | `ResearchTaskRow` / `ResearchTaskInfoRow` / `ResearchResultRow` typed views over raw positional `POLL_RESEARCH` rows that centralise the single-level positions `_research_task_parser.py` used to open-code (#1501) |
| `_row_adapters/sources.py` | `SourceRow` / `SourceRowShape` typed views over raw positional source RPC rows |
| `artifacts.py`, `research.py`, `utils.py` | Public helper modules for artifact retry, research citation/report utilities, and common async helpers |
| `_research_task_parser.py` | Internal parser for research task result-type selection |
| `_notebooks.py` | `client.notebooks` API + source-id resolver |
| `_notebook_payloads.py` | Stable `batchexecute` notebook RPC request payload builders (currently `SUGGEST_PROMPTS`) |
| `_sources.py` | `client.sources` API |
| `_artifacts.py` | `client.artifacts` API — owns artifact generation orchestration directly (see ADR-0012) |
| `_chat/api.py` | `client.chat` API |
| `_research.py` | `client.research` API |
| `_research_import.py` | Free-function helpers for `ResearchAPI` source import + verification: URL normalization, the report-source predicate, imported-entry/merge helpers, and the #1961 idempotency pre-filter (skip already-present URLs) with its `already_present` side-channel carrier. Split out of `_research.py` under the ADR-0008 module-size ratchet. |
| `_notes.py` | `client.notes` API |
| `_sharing.py` | `client.sharing` API |
| `_labels.py` | `client.labels` API — source labels (topic groupings); pure-RPC like `SharingAPI`, plus a narrow `list_sources` callable for the membership→`Source` join in `sources()` |
| `_collections.py` | `client.collections` API — account-level notebook groups; reuses the label RPCs (type-3, null notebook parent, `source_path="/"`), plus a narrow `list_notebooks` callable for the membership→`Notebook` join in `notebooks()` |
| `_settings.py` | `client.settings` API |
| `_note_service.py` | Service layer managing note CRUD, note-backed content generation, and sync |
| `_mind_map.py` | Specific adapter service representing mind-maps, backed by standard notes |
| `_mind_maps_api.py` | `client.mind_maps` API — unified surface over both mind-map backends (note-backed JSON + interactive studio-artifact), dispatching each op to the correct RPC family (#1256) |
| `_artifact/downloads.py` | Asynchronous download coordinator for finished artifacts |
| `_artifact/_redirect_guard.py` | Per-redirect-hop host/scheme revalidation for downloads — rejects off-allowlist / non-HTTPS redirect targets before the request is sent (#1521) |
| `_artifact/_download_client.py` | Download trusted-host allowlist + transport-aware client factory — wires the #1521 redirect guard for httpx (event hook) or the opt-in curl_cffi (`get_guarded` manual loop) |
| `_artifact/formatters.py` | Markdown, HTML, and plain text formatters for artifacts |
| `_artifact/payloads.py` | Stable CREATE_ARTIFACT / GENERATE_MIND_MAP request payload builders |
| `_artifact/validation.py` | Input-validation guards for the `ArtifactsAPI` facade (`generate_report` format coercion, `export` exactly-one-of target), kept in a sibling module so the facade stays under the module-size ratchet (#1874) |
| `_artifact/generation.py` | Generation kickoff service (`generate_*`, `revise_slide`, `retry_failed`) extracted from `ArtifactsAPI`; the facade keeps thin delegators |
| `_artifact/listing.py` | Listing and filtering operations for notebook artifacts |
| `_artifact/polling.py` | Poll coordination service for artifact generation tasks |
| `_source/add.py` | Core service layer for adding text, URL, or Google Drive sources |
| `_source/batch.py` | True-batch URL `ADD_SOURCE` service for the existing MCP/REST batch endpoints: typed positional outcomes, omitted-row reconciliation, and fail-closed transport/duplicate ambiguity policy |
| `_source/drive_import.py` | Auto-route add-from-Drive (#1884): download + upload the upload-only Drive types (epub/docx/txt/…); native import (`add_drive`) instead takes Docs/Slides/Sheets + PDF by reference; header-first cookie-authed streaming fetch behind injected seams |
| `_source/content.py` | Core service layer for fetching source HTML/markdown content |
| `_source/markdown.py` | Source fulltext HTML-to-Markdown conversion policy, including Markdown-source and LaTeX/table handling |
| `_source/listing.py` | Core service layer for listing notebook sources |
| `_source/polling.py` | Poll coordination service for active source conversions |
| `_source/upload.py` | Concurrency-gated upload pipeline for source files |
| `_source/_upload_decode.py` | Pure decode/validation helpers for the upload pipeline (URL redaction, ADD_SOURCE_FILE source-id extraction, content-type policy), extracted from `upload.py` |
| `_source/upload_payloads.py` | Stable source upload registration, rename, and resumable-upload request builders |
| `_label/params.py` | Stable CREATE_LABEL / LIST_LABELS / UPDATE_LABEL / DELETE_LABEL request payload builders (with the shared `_opts()` request-options wrapper) |
| `_collection/params.py` | Collection request payload builders reusing the label RPCs — null notebook_id, type-3 discriminator, `[1,3]` opts tail; add/remove notebook-membership fieldmask and `create`'s options wrapper are live-captured (PR #2009) |
| `_notebook_metadata.py` | Metadata protocol schemas for sub-clients |
| `_url_utils.py`, `urls.py` | URL parsing/validation internals and the public URL helper facade |
| `_sharing_manager.py` | Direct sharing management logic |
| `_version_check.py` | Dynamic client-side version deprecation guard |
| `_version_info.py` | Human-facing `version_string()` — package version + short git commit (embedded by `hatch_build.py` at build time, or live `git` from a checkout) |
| `_chat/notes.py` | Chat-adjacent note saving workflow adapter |
| `_chat/history.py` | Server-backed complete-history snapshot and user-question turn counting for authoritative `AskResult.turn_number` values |
| `_chat/wire.py` | Streamed-chat wire request construction + response parsing for the chat client |
| `_chat/transport.py` | Chat-specific error mapping over the shared transport pipeline |
| `_chat/deleted_tracker.py` | Bounded `RecentlyDeletedConversations` set — `delete_conversation` records the id (under the conversation lock) so a concurrent null-conversation ask, after acquiring that lock, detects a mid-flight delete and drops `resolved_id_override` to recover the server's real conversation id post-POST (#1875) |
| `_middleware/chain.py` | Constructs the middleware chain in the canonical ADR-0009 order |
| `_middleware/*.py` | Modular middleware implementations (drain, metrics, semaphore, retry, auth, error injection, tracing) |
| `rpc/types.py` | RPC method IDs (source of truth) |
| `auth.py` | Authentication facade — **almost pure re-exports** (the only remaining function body is `async def enumerate_accounts`, which binds `_poke_session` as a default dependency; ADR-0003 records the optional-`async` audit command). Every other top-level name forwards from the relevant `_auth/*` module: `auth._validate_required_cookies` is identity-equal to `_auth.cookie_policy._validate_required_cookies`, and `load_auth_from_storage` / `AuthTokens` live in `_auth/tokens.py`. **ADR-0003's flat-re-export goal was closed by ADR-0014.** Tests that need to rebind policy names patch `_auth.cookie_policy.X` directly. |
| `_auth/paths.py` | Storage paths and filesystem helpers |
| `_auth/extraction.py` | Cookie/token extraction from browser sessions |
| `_auth/cookies.py` | Compatibility cookie loaders/converters and logging boundaries over the pure codecs + `_update_cookie_input` |
| `_auth/cookie_policy.py` | Cookie-domain allowlist, `build_cookie_domain_allowlist` builder, and policy decisions |
| `_auth/cookie_semantics.py` | Dependency-bottom cookie scalar/row codecs: shape, expiry, legacy/rookiepy adaptation, stdlib construction, and row serialization |
| `_auth/cookie_types.py` | Canonical immutable `Cookie`/`CookieJar` values; depends downward only on cookie policy and semantics (ADR-0032) |
| `_auth/cookie_filter.py` | Pure raw capture/domain filter and value-free malformed-row diagnostics; no paths, I/O, locks, commits, or lifecycle state (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/profile_account.py` | Dependency-bottom immutable account/directive/domain/session values and pure namespace parsers; consumed by profile documents, `ProfileStore`, and the raw storage adapters (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/profile_document.py` | Recursively immutable, lossless raw profile snapshot with isolated typed views and copy-on-write cookie/namespace updates; consumed by the pure cookie merge leaf and its storage transaction adapter (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/cookie_merge.py` | Pure immutable cookie snapshot/CAS and permanent no-baseline overlay decisions. Its post-merge baseline selects accepted identities from authoritative final rows and retains rejected identities from the old baseline; no paths, locks, I/O, logging, facade, or lifecycle dependencies (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/credential_io.py` | Sealed typed profile/master-token commit capability over the sole unchecked atomic forwarder (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/master_token_types.py` | Immutable redacted token value + permissive pure legacy-record codec (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/master_token_file.py` | Explicit-path one-sample raw/typed token I/O + canonical bounded-lock commit (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/mint_service.py` | Stateless master-token exchange/cookie minting + sole raw RotateCookies wire; no disk or policy imports (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/master_token_bootstrap.py` | One-store bootstrap/re-mint/missing-storage coordinator; owns ordering, outcomes, and cancellation settlement without runtime/client or arbitrary token-file capability (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/profile_store.py` | Path-owned fresh document/session/account/derived-token reads, token/account writes, blocking cookie transactions, and bounded remint/login/minted replacement; minted owns latest-owner/filter/rebind/commit (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/profile_migration.py` | Legacy account context, lossless two-read resolution, promotion, retryable single-flight scheduler/exit drain, and login/account reconciliation (ADR-0034) |
| `_auth/account_email.py` | Generation-safe persisted/live account-email matching, probing, cache results, and exact-document CAS self-heal |
| `_auth/browser_cookie_recovery.py` | Shim: re-exports the captured-cookie validate/heal seam from `psidts_recovery.py` (removed at next major) |
| `_auth/browser_state_validation.py` | Shim: re-exports `heal_captured_state` from `browser_capture.py` (removed at next major) |
| `_auth/browser_capture.py` | One deep module for the browser launch→capture→filter→heal→persist core (ADR-0033 merge: absorbed `browser_state_validation.py` + `login_wait_trace.py`), lazy `playwright`; shared by the interactive CLI login adapter (`cli/services/playwright_login.py`) and the layer-3 headless re-auth layer (ADR-0021). Carries the login-wait DEBUG tracing (host-only `trace_url`, inert when DEBUG is off) and the never-raising `heal_captured_state` |
| `_auth/_browser_cookie_filter.py` | Shim: re-exports `storage.py`'s exact alias of the canonical `cookie_filter` function (removed at next major) |
| `_auth/browser_launch_errors.py` | `CHANNEL_BROWSERS` registry + `classify_launch_failure` launch-failure triage (not-installed / bundled-Chromium-missing / Windows `spawn UNKNOWN` execution veto); pure leaf of `browser_capture.py` (ADR-0008) |
| `_auth/headless_reauth.py` | Layer-3 headless re-auth decision layer: opt-in/profile-gated, typed honest outcomes (`HeadlessReauthStatus`); drives `run_browser_capture(headless=True, interactive=False)`. Local-unattended-only |
| `cli/label_cmd.py` | `label` command group (list/sources/generate/create/rename/emoji/add/remove/delete); thin Click shells over `client.labels`, `_app.labels`, and the label-listing service (ADR-0008/0021) |
| `cli/collection_cmd.py` | `collection` command group (list/notebooks/create/rename/add/remove/delete); account-level (no `--notebook` option); thin Click shells over `client.collections` + `_app.collections` (ADR-0008/0021) |
| `cli/services/label_listing.py` | `label` CLI service: the `label list` members→source-titles join (`execute_label_list`/`LabelListPlan`). Re-exports `resolve_label_id` + `LabelResolutionError` from `_app/labels.py` (the composite `<id\|name>` resolver moved to the neutral layer; the re-export keeps `from .services.label_listing import resolve_label_id` resolving for the command layer + tests) |
