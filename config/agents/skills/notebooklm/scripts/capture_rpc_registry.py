"""Capture NotebookLM's live RPC id registry from the web bundle and diff it
against ``src/notebooklm/rpc/types.py``.

NotebookLM declares every ``batchexecute`` RPC in its (public, gstatic-served) JS
bundle as::

    _.fD("<rpc_id>", <ReqCtor>, <RespCtor>, [<flags>, "/<Service>.<Method>"])

(The registration helper is currently minified to ``_.fD``; it was ``_.uD`` in an
earlier bundle. The scraper does **not** depend on the helper name — it anchors on
the quoted ``"/<Service>.<Method>"`` path — so a future rename of this helper does
not blank the diff.)

The obfuscated ``<rpc_id>`` values are this project's #1 breakage class — they
rotate without notice and a stale id silently breaks the affected operation. This
script extracts the live ``id -> /Service.Method`` map and diffs it against the
ids we hardcode, surfacing four classes:

* CONFIRMED       — our id is still registered (shown with its decoded method name)
* ABSENT          — our id no longer appears in the bundle at all (rotation/stale — the alarm)
* PRESENT-UNPARSED— our id string is in the bundle but its registration form wasn't
                    parsed (not a rotation; a parser gap to widen, not an alert)
* UNMAPPED        — a live RPC the bundle declares that we don't expose, grouped by
                    service family: **current** (old `LabsTailwind*` consumer backend
                    — callable on our cohort now, just unexposed), **enterprise** (the
                    Discovery-Engine domain services — the NotebookLM Enterprise /
                    Agentspace surface on `discoveryengine.googleapis.com`, behind a
                    server-side VPC Service Controls perimeter; not consumer-callable,
                    not a consumer migration target), or **other**

Beyond the rpc-id registry, the same bundle carries the studio-feature **enum
maps** (``switch(code){case N:return "Label"}`` blocks for VideoFormat /
AudioFormat / app-variants), the ``Yp`` **quota-code** map (a feature-rollout
early-warning surface), and proto **required-field assertions** (schema-shape
drift). ``--check-enums`` extracts and diffs the switch enums against the int
enums in ``rpc/types.py`` with the same four-class spirit as the id diff, but a
distinct taxonomy — see :func:`diff_enums` for why ``NEW`` is report-only.

Auth: discovering the bundle URL needs **one authenticated homepage read** (an
unauthenticated request only returns the login app); fetching the bundle itself is
unauthenticated (public CDN). Run ``notebooklm login`` first, or pass
``--bundle-file`` to analyse a pre-saved bundle offline (no auth/network).

Cohort note: the bundle is shared between the consumer NotebookLM app and the
enterprise (Agentspace / Vertex AI Search) surface, so it registers BOTH RPC
generations. The Discovery-Engine ids (e.g. ``AzXHBd``/``NotebookService.*``) are
the *enterprise* surface — gated off for consumer accounts by a server-side VPC
Service Controls perimeter (live-probed 2026-06-16: grpc 7 ``VPC_SERVICE_CONTROLS``
/ ``CONSUMER_INVALID`` on ``discoveryengine.googleapis.com``), not a consumer
cohort that is "about to migrate".

Usage::

    python scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py                 # human-readable diff
    python scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py --json          # machine-readable snapshot
    python scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py --check         # exit 1 if any of our ids are ABSENT
    python scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py --check-enums    # exit 1 on CHANGED/STALE studio enums
    python scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py --check --check-enums  # both gates (combine freely)
    python scripts/capture_rpc_registry.py --bundle-file bundle.js   # offline, no auth

Exit codes are ``0`` for a clean/report-only run, ``1`` for confirmed RPC or
studio-enum drift, and ``2`` when the authenticated homepage is diverted to a
login, cookie-mismatch, or region/anti-abuse surface.  Auth/infrastructure
failures are deliberately distinct from drift so automation never turns an
unreadable app bundle into an "all RPC ids disappeared" alarm.
