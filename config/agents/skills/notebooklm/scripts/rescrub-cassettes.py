"""Bulk re-scrub VCR cassettes for shape-based leaks the recorder missed.

Collapses every ``lh3.googleusercontent.com/(?:a|ogw)/<token>`` avatar URL to
the canonical ``SCRUBBED_AVATAR_URL`` placeholder, every double-encoded
``authuser%3D<email>`` redirect param to ``authuser%3DSCRUBBED_EMAIL%40example.com``
(issue #1368), and re-derives the chunked ``<count>\\n<payload>\\n`` byte-count
prefixes inside every recorded response body. Writes back only if anything
changed; idempotent on a clean tree.

Why this script exists
----------------------
The avatar-URL scrubber (PR #565) added
``lh3.googleusercontent.com/(?:a|ogw)/<token>`` → ``SCRUBBED_AVATAR_URL`` to
the canonical pattern registry, but the 61 cassettes recorded before that
pattern landed still embed the raw ``/ogw/`` avatar URLs. They are listed in
``tests/scripts/cassette_repair_allowlist.txt`` under the "/ogw/ avatar URL
group" header; this script is the one-off tool that walks each of those
cassettes, re-scrubs them in place, and reports a byte-level diff so reviewers
can verify the change set.

The same one-off-re-scrub need applies to the double-encoded
``authuser%3D<email>`` shape (issue #1368): the canonical scrubber learned this
form only after 9 cassettes had already been recorded with the maintainer's
email leaked inside Google account-menu ``continue=`` redirect URLs, so they
need a re-scrub in place too.

Why we DON'T call ``scrub_string`` here
---------------------------------------
``cassette_patterns.scrub_string`` applies every pattern in
:data:`SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` — including the escaped-display-name
scrubber that anchors on ``\\"First Last\\"`` inside double-encoded WRB
payloads. That pattern carries a small false-positive allowlist
(``DISPLAY_NAME_FALSE_POSITIVES``) covering font families, UI titles, and
a handful of artifact / notebook titles from the test corpus — but the
existing cassettes contain many more legitimate two-Capitalized-word
titles ("Agent Architecture Quiz", "Study Guide", "Answer Key", "Context
Caching Economics", ...) that would be silently clobbered to
``SCRUBBED_NAME`` and break the cli-vcr tests that rely on matching
those titles in the parsed response.

So the script applies ONLY the avatar-URL scrubber by name. Every other
pattern in the registry — display names, emails, cookies, tokens — is
already correctly applied on record by ``vcr_config.scrub_response`` and
has been for every cassette in the tree; running them again here cannot
produce new scrubs (the registry is idempotent on its own placeholders),
but it CAN produce display-name false positives the recorder's allowlist
was never tuned to cover.

The byte-count re-derivation (``recompute_chunk_prefix``) runs on every
body unconditionally — it's a documented no-op on bodies that don't look
chunked, and a safety net for any chunked body whose avatar URL inside a
WRB payload shifted its length.

Architecture notes
------------------
The script parses each cassette with PyYAML's **safe** loader
(``yaml.CSafeLoader`` if libyaml is available, else ``yaml.SafeLoader``) and
applies the scrubbers to every ``response.body.string`` field. After
scrubbing, the cassette is re-emitted with ``yaml.dump(data, Dumper=Dumper)``
— matching vcrpy's own serializer (``vcrpy/serializers/yamlserializer.py``)
— so a clean cassette round-trips identically. The safe-loader choice is
intentional (P1-22): the previous ``CLoader`` / ``Loader`` family
deserializes arbitrary Python via ``!!python/object`` tags and is a
documented remote-code-execution risk on untrusted input. The dumper side
stays on the standard ``CDumper`` / ``Dumper`` because the round-trip data
contains only ``str`` / ``bytes`` / ``dict`` / ``list`` / ``None`` /
``int`` — all of which the safe loader accepts without trouble.

We deliberately do NOT scrub the raw YAML text: a regex applied to the
wrapped YAML form could match across YAML line-wrap boundaries and corrupt
the file structure. Parsing first guarantees the scrubber only ever sees
the semantic string content the recorder produced, never the YAML
serialization artifacts around it.

Usage
-----
::

    uv run python scripts/rescrub-cassettes.py            # rescrub all
    uv run python scripts/rescrub-cassettes.py <paths...> # rescrub specific files

Exit codes:
    0 — done (whether or not anything changed)
    1 — a cassette failed to parse or write
