"""Drive a real FastMCP tool call across a live-jar invalidation.

Uses FastMCP's in-memory protocol transport, so the call goes through the actual
MCP tool dispatch rather than a hand-rolled shim. The bound client's live cookie
jar is emptied between two identical ``notebook_list`` calls; the second call
must return the same notebooks and leave a repopulated jar behind.

Result contract: ``{"before", "after", "live_cookies", "transport"}``.
