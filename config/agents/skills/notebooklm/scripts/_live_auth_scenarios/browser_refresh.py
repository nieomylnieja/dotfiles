"""Optional browser-backed mid-session recovery (Layer-2.5 refresh command).

The orchestrator points ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`` at
``examples/refresh_browser_cookies.py`` and opts the rung in mid-session, then
empties both the persisted cookie list and the live jar. Only the refresh
command can recover from that, and it must be invoked exactly once.

Result contract: ``{"before", "after", "refresh_command_calls", "live_cookies"}``.
