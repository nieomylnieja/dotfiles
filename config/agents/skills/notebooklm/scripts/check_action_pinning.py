"""Assert third-party actions in privileged workflows are SHA-pinned.

Pinning third-party GitHub Actions to a 40-character commit SHA (instead
of a floating tag like ``@v1`` or ``@release/v1``) is a defence against
upstream tag-hijacking and silent supply-chain compromise: a malicious
push to a tag we trust would otherwise execute under our secrets on the
next workflow run. This check is the static gate that keeps the
SHA-pinning invariant from regressing.

Scope:

* **Privileged workflows** — the hardcoded list below — run jobs that
  carry deploy keys, OIDC tokens, repo write scopes, or maintainer
  credentials. Every ``uses:`` referencing a third-party repo in those
  workflows must be SHA-pinned.
* **First-party ``actions/*`` actions** (e.g. ``actions/checkout``,
  ``actions/setup-python``) are owned by GitHub and may stay on floating
  tags. Dependabot still bumps them on a weekly cadence (see
  ``.github/dependabot.yml``).
* Non-privileged workflows are out of scope; they don't see secrets and
  can churn at floating-tag speed.

Comment convention: when a SHA is pinned, the line should be followed by
a human-readable tag comment so reviewers can read the intent without
visiting GitHub. Example::

    uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@cef221092ed1bacb1cc03d23a2d87d1d172e277b  # @ v1.14.0

The comment is advisory — this script does not enforce its presence
(Dependabot rewrites only the SHA, and a missing comment is a polish
finding, not a security gap). We enforce only the SHA itself.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_action_pinning.py
    python scripts/check_action_pinning.py --workflow-dir custom/path

Exit codes:
    0  Every third-party action in every privileged workflow is SHA-pinned.
    1  One or more violations found (printed to stderr with file:line).
    2  Argument error / privileged workflow file missing.
