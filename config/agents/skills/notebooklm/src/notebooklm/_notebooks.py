            Wraps the underlying CREATE_NOTEBOOK RPC in a
            probe-then-retry loop. On a transient transport failure
            (5xx / 429 / network), the wrapper lists notebooks and
            checks whether a new notebook with the requested title
            appeared since the call started. If exactly one match is
            found, that notebook is returned without re-issuing the

            because the situation is ambiguous (concurrent creates by
            other clients) and the caller must intervene.

            "Appeared since the call started" is measured against a
            pre-create snapshot of the notebook ids. If that snapshot
            could not be taken, the probe cannot attribute *any* match
