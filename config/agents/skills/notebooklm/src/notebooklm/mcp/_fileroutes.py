"""Signed-URL file-transfer routes mounted on the FastMCP http app (ADR-0024).

Three custom routes carry binaries **outside** the MCP JSON-RPC channel so the
claude.ai connector works for local-file upload and artifact download::

    GET      /files/dl/{token}   -> stream the artifact   (FileResponse)
    GET      /files/ul/{token}   -> minimal upload page    (file picker + fetch POST)
    POST|PUT /files/ul/{token}   -> stream a RAW body -> add the source

The HMAC-signed token is the **sole** auth for these routes: a browser opening a
signed link cannot carry the MCP bearer/OAuth credential, and FastMCP does not
wrap custom routes with ``RequireAuthMiddleware`` (only the ``/mcp`` route) — a
regression test pins both facts. The token encodes the operation parameters
(notebook id, title/mime, artifact type/format), so the handlers hold no state.

Upload is a **raw request body** (``request.stream()``), never ``request.form()``:
``python-multipart`` is in the ``server`` extra only, not ``mcp``, and a raw body
also lets a sandbox ``curl``/``PUT`` (the FutureSearch pattern) reuse the same
handler. The real DoS defense is the **running byte cap** while streaming into the
temp file; the ``Content-Length`` check is just an early 413.

This module imports NOTHING from ``server/`` (which pulls ``fastapi`` — absent on
``mcp``-only installs) and NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.

#: ENOSPC. This bounds aggregate temp pressure to ``_MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS`` ×
#: ``MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES``; excess uploads get a fast 429 (no disk touched). A single

_MAX_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS = 4

#: Cap concurrent in-flight downloads. Each accepted download spools the artifact
#: to a private temp dir and fetches it from Google before streaming it out, so a

#: CORS for the ``/files/ul`` POST — the in-app MCP-App widget (Phase 3) uploads cross-origin
#: from its sandboxed iframe, so the browser sends a preflight and needs an allow-origin on the
#: response. ``*`` is safe here: the signed single-use token is the sole auth (no cookies /
#: ambient credentials, ADR-0024), so a hostile page that can't mint a token gains nothing.

#: deviations from the REST table (because these routes are a *gateway* to the
#: NotebookLM backend, not the backend itself): ``AUTH`` / ``CONFIG`` /
#: ``DEPENDENCY`` → **502**, not 401/500 — they are authenticated by the signed
#: token, so a *server-side* broken
#: Google session is an upstream-dependency failure (Bad Gateway) the token-bearing
#: caller cannot fix by re-authenticating (401 would be misleading); and
#: ``LIBRARY`` → **502**, not 500, for the same gateway reason (an unclassified
#: library error reaching here is still an upstream failure, not an internal bug of
#: the route). ``UNEXPECTED`` stays 500 (a genuine route bug) but is unreachable via
