"""FastMCP server construction for notebooklm-py.

Design highlights:

- **One client per process, bound at lifespan.** The FastMCP lifespan opens a
  single :class:`~notebooklm.client.NotebookLMClient` via
  ``from_storage(profile=...)`` inside the server loop (satisfies the ADR-0004
  loop-affinity contract) and keeps it for the process lifetime. Its keepalive
  task gives long sessions cookie rotation for free.
- **Transport-neutral.** Tools are thin adapters over the ``_app/`` cores; this
  package imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` (enforced by
  ``tests/_guardrails/test_mcp_boundary.py``).
- **Tools register through :func:`register_all`.** Phase 1 ships no tools yet —
  the registration seam is in place and tool modules plug in additively in
  Phase 2.

            profile when ``None``. Also drives process-wide profile resolution
            for diagnostics such as the ``server_info`` tool.
        client_factory: Test seam — a zero-arg callable returning an async context
            manager that yields a client. Defaults to
            ``NotebookLMClient.from_storage(profile=...)``.
        auth: Optional FastMCP auth provider gating the HTTP transport. Passed
            **explicitly** by the caller — this function never reads
            ``NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_TOKEN`` itself, so stdio runs and the unit suite
            never silently attach auth (the token check + provider build live in
            :mod:`.__main__`, only on the network-bound http path).
        file_transfer: Optional remote file-transfer config (signer + validated
            public base URL). When set, the two file tools emit signed URLs and the
            ``/files/*`` routes are mounted on the http app; when ``None`` (stdio,
            or http without a public URL) the tools keep / reject the path-based
            behavior and no routes are mounted (ADR-0024). Built only on the
            network-bound http path in :mod:`.__main__`.

    Returns:
        A configured :class:`~fastmcp.FastMCP` server whose lifespan binds one
        client and which has every tool module registered.
