"""HMAC-signed, self-describing file-transfer tokens for the MCP side-channel.

The remote (HTTP) MCP transport brokers short-lived **signed URLs** so the
claude.ai connector's browser can upload a local binary or download an artifact
*outside* the JSON-RPC channel (ADR-0024). The token **encodes the operation
parameters**, so the ``/files/*`` route handlers hold no server-side state — the
token is the state. No ref-registry, no TTL sweeper.

Token wire format::

    base64url(json(payload)) + "." + base64url(HMAC-SHA256(key, body))

where ``body`` is the base64url(json(payload)) string the MAC is computed over.
Stdlib ``hmac``/``hashlib``/``base64``/``json``/``secrets`` only — no new dependency
(``itsdangerous`` is not installed). :meth:`FileLinkSigner.verify` enforces a max
token length **before** any decode/HMAC work, re-pads base64url, recomputes the
MAC in constant time (:func:`hmac.compare_digest`), checks ``exp``, and matches
the operation. The signing key is an ephemeral ``secrets.token_bytes(32)`` minted
at server start (a restart invalidating outstanding links is acceptable and
removes a secret to manage).

Every minted token also carries a random ``jti`` (like ``exp``, injected by
:meth:`FileLinkSigner.sign` and covered by the MAC). ``jti`` powers a **scoped
single-use** guarantee for the ``ul`` (upload) op: the ``/files/ul`` POST route
claims + burns the jti via :class:`ConsumedJtiStore` so a leaked upload link
cannot be replayed as a content-injection write primitive (ADR-0024, #1746). The
store is an ephemeral, bounded, inline-swept in-process set that dies with the
process just like the signing key — there is no *background* sweeper. Downloads
(``dl``) stay multi-use so ``Range``/resumable clients keep working; their jti is
present but not enforced.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.

#: one mint instant), then uploads file[0], file[1], … one after another, so the LAST
#: token must still be live after the sum of every earlier file's transfer plus the
#: user's file-picking think-time. At the 15-min link TTL a slow mobile link could
#: expire a later token mid-batch → a silent 403, the file lost (#1894). An hour
#: comfortably covers a realistic mobile batch of documents/photos.
#:
#: The longer window is a different — and smaller — risk class than the human_upload
#: link's: a pool token is (a) single-use (it authorizes exactly one *successful* add,
#: burned via :class:`ConsumedJtiStore`), (b) notebook-scoped, and (c) never shown to
#: the user or placed in a URL bar — it lives only inside the widget's
#: ``structuredContent`` / ``fetch`` body, never a location bar, history entry, or

#: browser (a genuinely higher-exposure surface); the widget pool never enters it.
