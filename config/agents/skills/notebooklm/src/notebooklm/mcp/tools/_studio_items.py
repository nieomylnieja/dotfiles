"""Cross-type Studio helpers shared by the Studio (``studio.py``) tools.

The Studio surface presents a notebook's **notes AND generated artifacts** as one
merged panel. These helpers own that merge + the cross-type reference resolution
used by ``studio_list(item=…)`` and ``studio_delete``:

* :func:`_studio_items` fetches + projects notes and artifacts into one flat list
  with a shared hyphenated ``type`` discriminator.
* :func:`_resolve_studio_item` resolves a ref (note OR artifact) over that merged
  list, raising the public NOT_FOUND / ambiguous errors on a miss / collision.

Split out of ``studio.py`` to keep that module under the ADR-0008 size budget;
it is cohesive (all cross-type note∩artifact plumbing) rather than an arbitrary
slice. This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
