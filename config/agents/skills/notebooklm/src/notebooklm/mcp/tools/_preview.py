"""Shared helper for the destructive tools' confirmation previews.

The single-type delete tools (``notebook_delete`` / ``source_delete``) build a
``needs_confirmation`` preview that includes the resolved resource's title. Each
fetches its own domain list (notebooks / sources), but the id-to-title match over
that list is identical, so it lives here. (Cross-type ``studio_delete`` gets its
preview title straight off the merged-list resolution instead.)

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
