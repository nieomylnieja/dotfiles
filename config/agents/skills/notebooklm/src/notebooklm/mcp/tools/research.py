"""Research MCP tools.

Thin adapters over the research surface:

* ``research_start`` calls ``client.research.start`` directly (web/drive source,
  fast/deep mode) and returns the started task. The neutral
  ``_app.source_research`` core bundles a CLI-shaped start→wait→import workflow
  (rich-coupled importer injection, flag validation); the MCP tool exposes the
  three steps as separate, agent-pollable tools instead, so it drives the client
  API directly.
* ``research_status`` drives the neutral ``_app.research.poll_and_classify`` core
  (a single non-blocking poll classified into render fields).
* ``research_import`` polls the notebook's completed research, then imports its
  sources via the timeout-tolerant ``client.research.import_sources_with_verification``
  (optionally narrowed by ``cited_only`` / bounded by ``max_sources``).
* ``research_cancel`` preflights the run via ``poll_and_classify`` and sends the
  fire-and-forget cancel unless the run is already terminal (``completed`` /
  ``failed``); a transiently-absent just-started run (replication lag) is still
  cancelled, and ``cancel_requested`` + ``run_status_before`` report honestly.

One id value threads the whole flow — the ``poll_task_id`` surfaced by
``research_start`` (deep's ``report_id`` / fast's ``task_id``). Every downstream
tool now accepts it under the SAME name, ``poll_task_id`` (issue #1789), so the
value copied from one tool's output pastes verbatim into the next. The original
per-tool names — ``research_status``/``research_import``'s ``task_id`` and
``research_cancel``'s ``run_id`` — remain accepted as deprecated aliases for one
release (they emit a ``DeprecationWarning`` and a ``deprecation`` note in the
result); see ``docs/deprecations.md``.

Although the design sketch lists ``research_start(query, …)`` without a notebook
argument, ``client.research.start`` is notebook-scoped (it needs a
``notebook_id``), so the tool takes a ``notebook`` reference — a deliberate
follow-the-code accommodation (the design also routes name/id resolution through
the notebook list).

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
