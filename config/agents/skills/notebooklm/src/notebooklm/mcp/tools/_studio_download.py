"""Download plumbing shared by the Studio (``studio.py``) tools and the remote
file-transfer route (``_fileroutes.py``).

The downloadable-artifact registry + the ref/transport helpers that back
``studio_download`` live here (rather than inside ``studio.py``) because
``_fileroutes.py`` needs the same ``_DOWNLOAD_SPECS`` / ``_resolve_artifact_id``
to serve a brokered download URL — keeping them in the tool module made it a
de-facto shared module. Split out to honor the ADR-0008 1000-line cap and to name
the coupling.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``: it consumes the canonical
neutral registry from ``_app.download_specs`` directly.

    still hands out the ``resource_link`` (the guaranteed deliverable — the link needs
    no RPC to mint on the "latest" path, and opening it later re-runs this fetch, so a
    transient hiccup must not fail the whole ``studio_download`` call). Explicit-id
    refs are already validated before this runs, so a swallowed error here can only be
    an infra/transient failure, never a bad-id miss.
