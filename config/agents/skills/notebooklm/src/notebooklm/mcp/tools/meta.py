"""Meta MCP tool: ``server_info``.

Reports the package version and a local auth-health probe so an agent can tell,
before any notebook call, whether the server is authenticated. The auth check
reuses the transport-neutral :func:`notebooklm._app.auth_check.run_auth_check`
core (storage-exists / JSON-valid / cookies-present / SID), driven against the
on-disk ``storage_state.json`` the runtime would actually load (no network
round-trip — ``test_fetch`` is off).

``server_info`` takes no notebook argument and is read-only. The storage path +
active profile are resolved via the neutral :mod:`notebooklm.paths` helpers, so
this module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.

It also accepts an opt-in ``include_account`` flag that adds the account
notebook/source limits + the global output language (for an agent to pace against
quota and know which language artifacts generate in). That block requires a *live*
session, so it is off by default — the default call stays a fast, network-free
auth-health probe that works even when unauthenticated.
