"""Source MCP tools.

Thin adapters over the transport-neutral ``_app.source_*`` cores: resolve the
notebook (and, where applicable, the source) reference via the Phase 1
:mod:`._resolve` helpers, drive the ``execute_source_*`` executors, and project
the typed result to the wire with :func:`to_jsonable`.

``source_add`` is a hybrid over two cores: ``url``/``text``/``file``/``youtube``
flow through ``_app.source_add`` (``build_source_add_plan`` + ``execute_source_add``);
``drive`` flows through ``_app.source_mutations.execute_source_add_drive`` (the
neutral ``source_add`` core has no Drive path). It also has a batch mode
(``urls=[...]``) that adds many http(s) URLs sequentially and returns an explicit
per-item result list. ``source_wait`` waits for a subset when ``sources`` is
given, one source when ``source`` is given, else every source in the notebook.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.

        """Add a source to a notebook — single, batch, or in-channel bytes. Accepts a notebook name or ID.

        Call in exactly ONE of two modes:

        **Single mode** — pass ``source_type``; it selects the required input:

        * ``url`` / ``youtube`` — require ``url`` (``youtube`` → a YouTube link).
        * ``text``    — requires ``text``; ``title`` optional.
        * ``file``    — over **stdio**, requires ``path`` (a local path on the
          server host). Over the **remote (http) connector** the host filesystem is
          unreachable, so it returns ``upload_required`` with two actor paths:
          ``human_upload`` (open the signed URL in a browser) and ``agent_upload`` (an
          agent POSTs the bytes as the raw body); ``agent_instructions`` gives the rule
          (try ``agent_upload``, else ``human_upload.url``). Alternatively pass
          ``bytes_base64`` to add a SMALL file in-channel (any transport, no signed URL):
          standard base64 (not URL-safe) ≤ 10,000 chars (≈ 7 KB); ``filename`` seeds the
          title/extension. A bigger file must take the signed URL (≤ 200 MiB).
        * ``drive``   — requires ``document_id`` + ``mime_type`` (one of
          google-doc|google-slides|google-sheets|pdf; required, no default — a wrong
          default fails non-Doc imports, #1827).

        The single-mode content inputs are mutually exclusive — supply only the one
        your ``source_type`` requires (``bytes_base64`` is the ``file`` alternative to
        ``path``). An explicit ``title`` for url/youtube/drive is honored via a post-add
        rename; a miss returns ``title_override_applied: false`` (#1960).

        Pass ``wait=true`` to block until the ONE added source finishes processing and
        return the ``source_wait`` aggregate (buckets + per-bucket ``*_count`` +
        ``total_count``) with a top-level ``source_id`` (present even on timeout/failure);
        ``timeout``/``interval`` tune the poll. ``wait`` is single-mode only and NOT for a
        remote ``file`` signed-URL upload (add it, then ``source_wait``). Without ``wait``
        the added source is echoed under ``source`` with string ``kind`` /
        ``status_label`` labels; imports are ASYNCHRONOUS so the echo is usually still
        ``processing``/``preparing`` — confirm with ``source_wait`` or
        ``source_list(status="error")``. A failed import is flagged inline
        (``status_label="error"`` + a ``warning``); ``source_wait`` also flags a READY web
        page with suspiciously thin text (dead link/soft-404/paywall).

        **Batch mode** — pass ``urls`` (a list of **http/https URLs**, YouTube links
        included) to add many in one call instead of one round-trip each. Each entry is
        validated and added independently; the response is an explicit per-item list so
        partial failure is never hidden::

            {"notebook_id": …, "added": <int>, "failed": <int>,
             "results": [{"input": "<url>", "status": "added", "source_id": …,
                          "title": …, "status_label": …, "warning"?: …},
                         {"input": "<url>", "status": "error",
                          "error": {"code": …, "message": …, "retriable": …, "hint"?: …}}]}

        ``results`` is positional (``results[i]`` is for ``urls[i]``); ``status`` is
        ``"added"`` or ``"error"`` (the ADD outcome). An ``"added"`` item also carries the
        source's ``status_label`` and, when the add response already reflects a failed
        import, an inline ``warning`` — same failure-signaling as single mode. A per-URL
        **input** failure (bad URL / 404 / SSRF-blocked host) isolates as an ``error``
        item; a **fatal** service failure (expired auth, rate limit, upstream 5xx) aborts
        the whole call. Batch is URL-only: a non-URL entry (plain text, a local path,
        ``file://``/``ftp://``) is reported as a per-item ``VALIDATION`` error. The
        single-mode named inputs (incl. ``bytes_base64``/``filename``/``wait``) are not
        valid with ``urls``; ``allow_internal`` applies to every entry.

    The saving over N single ``source_add`` calls is the per-call MCP/agent
    round-trip overhead: the URL adds themselves run **sequentially** here, on
    purpose — concurrent bulk writes invite backend rate-limiting (CLAUDE.md
    pitfall #4). A **fatal** failure (expired auth, ``RATE_LIMITED``, an upstream
    5xx — classified by :func:`_app.source_batch.batch_item_is_fatal`, shared with
    the REST route) is re-raised so the whole tool call fails at the top level,
    letting the agent re-auth/retry; only per-URL 4xx-input failures isolate.

    Each entry is added with ``source_type="url"`` so :func:`add_core.validate_url`
    enforces the http/https scheme allowlist + SSRF guard per item; a non-URL entry
    (plain text, a local path, ``file://``/``ftp://``) is reported as a per-item
    ``VALIDATION`` error and is NEVER silently added as text or read off the local
    filesystem. A per-item **input** failure is isolated (recorded + skipped), so
    partial — or total — input failure is always visible per item rather than
    collapsed into one success flag. Results are positional (``results[i]`` ↔
    ``urls[i]``); the per-item ``error`` reuses the same structured contract a
    single-mode failure raises.

    An ``"added"`` item also carries the source's ``status_label`` (the async-import
    status) and, when the add response already reflects a failed import
    (``is_error``), an inline ``warning`` — mirroring single mode's
    :func:`_add_result_payload` failure-signaling (#1679) per entry. A
    synchronously-READY web-page item may additionally carry a content-sanity
    ``warning`` (thin / soft-404 body — see :func:`_thin_content_warning`); most
