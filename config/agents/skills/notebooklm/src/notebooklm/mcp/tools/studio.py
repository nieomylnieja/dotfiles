"""Studio MCP tools (notes + generated artifacts).

Thin adapters over the transport-neutral artifact cores:

* ``studio_list`` reads ``client.artifacts.list`` directly (like ``source_list``).
* ``studio_generate`` is a hybrid over the neutral ``generate`` core: it builds a
  :class:`~notebooklm._app.generate.GenerationPlan` via ``build_generation_plan``
  (which enum-maps + validates the per-kind options) and drives
  ``execute_generation`` with **pass-through** notebook/source resolvers (MCP has
  already resolved the notebook id and supplies full source ids). Each ``type``
  routes to the matching ``client.artifacts.generate_*`` method.
* ``studio_status`` is the **stateless** poll path (``_app.artifacts.poll_artifact``
  → ``client.artifacts.poll_status``) so an agent can poll a ``task_id`` across
  separate tool calls without holding server state.
* ``studio_download`` is a hybrid over the neutral ``download`` core: each
  ``type`` selects a :class:`~notebooklm._app.download.DownloadTypeSpec` row and
  ``build_download_plan`` + ``execute_download`` run with pass-through resolvers.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` — its download rows come
from the canonical neutral ``_app.download_specs`` registry through
``_studio_download``, rather than from ``cli/_download_specs.py``.

#: Per-kind default option values mirroring the CLI ``generate`` Click ``Choice``
#: defaults, so a bare ``studio_generate(notebook, type=…)`` succeeds without
#: the agent restating every enum. The agent can override any of these by passing
#: the matching keyword; ``build_generation_plan`` enum-maps + validates them.

#: Per-kind agent-settable options → their accepted choices. ``None`` choices mean
#: free text (only ``style_prompt``). This single table drives all three things the
#: agent-facing override path needs:
#:
#: * **Choice validation** up front, so a bad value surfaces as a clean ``VALIDATION``
#:   error rather than a raw ``KeyError`` from a generate-core display-name lookup that
#:   runs before its own choice validation (the CLI never hits this — Click validates
#:   the ``Choice`` first).
#: * **The ``style`` collision** — ``video`` and ``infographic`` both take a ``style``
#:   kwarg but with DIFFERENT choice sets (overlapping only on ``auto``/``anime``/
#:   ``kawaii``); keying choices by ``artifact_type`` keeps them apart.
#: * **Wrong-kind rejection** — an option valid for some other kind (e.g. ``orientation``
#:   passed to ``quiz``) is rejected here, because the neutral core silently *ignores*
#:   irrelevant extras (``build_generation_plan`` "picks the relevant subset"), which
#:   would otherwise be a confusing silent no-op for an agent.
#:
#: The literal choice tuples are DUPLICATED from the neutral core's private ``_*_MAP``
#: maps (MCP must not import them — the CLI/MCP boundary rule); a guardrail test pins
#: these tuples equal to the core maps so they can't silently drift. ``map_kind`` has no
#: core map (the core reads it raw and any non-``interactive`` value routes note-backed),
#: so it is validated here ONLY.
