"""Notebook-sharing MCP tools.

Thin adapters over ``client.sharing`` (SharingAPI): resolve the notebook ref once
via :func:`resolve_notebook`, call the sharing method directly, and project the
typed :class:`~notebooklm._types.sharing.ShareStatus` to the wire with
**string-labeled enums**. The share enums are ``int, Enum`` (``rpc/types.py``), so
a raw :func:`to_jsonable` pass would leak integers (``access=1`` etc.) — the
projection here maps them to stable labels instead.

Four tools cover the six ``client.sharing`` operations: the notebook-link settings
(``set_public`` + ``set_view_level``) fold into :func:`share_set_access`, and the
per-user grant operations (``add_user`` + ``update_user`` — the *same* backend RPC)
fold into an upsert :func:`share_set_user`. ``share_status`` (read-only) and
``share_remove_user`` (destructive, confirm-gated) stay discrete because their tool
annotations differ.

``view_level`` is deliberately OMITTED from every ``get_status``-derived payload:
``GET_SHARE_STATUS`` does not report it, so ``ShareStatus.from_api_response``
hardcodes ``FULL_NOTEBOOK``. Shipping that would be confidently-wrong data (it
would read ``"full"`` even for a chat-only notebook). The only trustworthy value
is the one ``set_view_level`` overrides into its own return, so ``view_level`` is
surfaced ONLY when :func:`share_set_access` actually set it.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
