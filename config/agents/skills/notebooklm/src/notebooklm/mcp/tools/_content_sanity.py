"""Advisory content-sanity checks for READY web-page sources.

A dead link / soft-404 / paywalled page is often ingested as a READY source with
little/no extractable text (or a full-bodied "broken link" boilerplate) — a
"ghost source" that add-time status can't catch because a soft-404 serves HTTP
200. :func:`_thin_content_warning` returns a non-blocking, advisory ``warning``
for such a source; :func:`_annotate_thin_warnings` runs it concurrently over the
ready web-page views and attaches the warning in place.

Extracted from ``sources.py`` (it stayed under the ADR-0008 module-size budget):
the logic is a self-contained, reusable unit consumed by both the wait aggregate
(:func:`._waitagg._aggregate_wait_outcomes`, behind ``source_wait`` /
``source_add(wait=True)``) and the ``source_add`` batch
(:func:`._sources._add_url_batch`). Reads only ``_app.source_content`` — imports
NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` (MCP-layer boundary).

    (a soft-404 serves HTTP 200). Two body-only signals (the title is **never**
    scanned — a generic "Article | …" title carries no signal and matching it would
    false-positive on legit CMS pages):

    1. **char-thin** — fewer than :data:`_THIN_SOURCE_CHAR_THRESHOLD` chars of

    2. **dead-link boilerplate** — a body SHORTER than

       :data:`_SOFT_404_PHRASES` marker (a full-bodied "Whoops! broken link" page
       that sails past the char-thin rule). The length gate runs BEFORE the body is
       casefolded, so a large healthy page is never lowercased + scanned.

       :data:`_BOT_CHALLENGE_BODY_SCAN_LIMIT` chars (a wider cap than the dead-link
       pass) that contains a :data:`_BOT_CHALLENGE_PHRASES` marker (a Cloudflare
       "Just a moment…" or Akamai "Access Denied" page that ingests as ready but is
       not the real content). Dead-link takes precedence when a body trips both.

    **web-page only** (short pasted text / transcripts are legitimate, never flagged;
    callers also pre-filter). **best-effort**: the body fetch reuses
    ``source_read``'s (detail="full") ``GET_SOURCE``, bounded by
    :data:`_THIN_SOURCE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; ANY failure (timeout, transport,
    unexpected shape) degrades to ``None`` so it can never break a wait
