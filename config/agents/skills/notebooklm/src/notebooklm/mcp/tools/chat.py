"""Chat MCP tools.

Thin adapters over the chat surface:

* ``chat_ask`` calls ``client.chat.ask`` directly. The neutral ``_app.chat`` core
  owns the CLI's conversation-id selection ladder + save-as-note workflow, none of
  which the MCP tool needs — an explicit ``conversation_id`` passes straight
  through, and omitting it continues the notebook's most-recent conversation (the
  same default the ``ask`` RPC has).
* ``chat_configure`` drives ``_app.chat.execute_configure``. ``goal`` maps to the
  core's ``persona`` argument (a non-empty value selects the ``CUSTOM`` chat goal).

Neither the ``ask`` RPC nor ``execute_configure`` emits progress events, so this
module wires no :class:`~notebooklm._app.events.ProgressSink` — there is nothing
to map and (per the plan) such events are simply dropped. The CLI's Rich-markup
status prose lives only in the ``_app.chat`` *ask-ladder* helpers the MCP tool
deliberately bypasses, so no ``[dim]``/``[yellow]`` markup can reach MCP output.

Both bodies wrap in :func:`mcp_errors`. This module imports NO ``click`` /
``rich`` / ``cli``.

        id/prefix/title; omit it to query every source. It accepts a real list, a
        JSON-array string, or a comma-separated string (the comma form cannot
        carry a source title that itself contains a comma — use a JSON array or a
        real list for those).

        ``history`` (optional, default 0): the max number of prior Q&A pairs
        (each a ``{question, answer}``) to also return (oldest-first), from the
        conversation as it stood *before* this question. There is no unbounded
        "all" value — pass a generously large number (e.g. 100) for the whole

        recall prior pairs without asking anything new; a recall-only call also
        echoes the ``conversation_id`` it read. Pass neither and the call is

        ``source_id`` / ``citation_number`` / ``cited_text``; ``full`` adds
        chunk-level char offsets and scores.

        ``suggest_followups`` (optional, default ``False``): when ``True`` the
        result also carries a ``suggested_prompts`` list of AI-suggested
        follow-up questions (each a ``{title, prompt}``), scoped to the same
        ``source_ids`` and steered by ``question`` when one is given. It works on
