"""Name / partial-id resolution for MCP tools.

MCP tools accept a human-friendly ``notebook`` / ``source`` reference and turn it
into a canonical backend id. The matching rules build on the neutral
:func:`notebooklm._app.resolve.resolve_ref` (full/partial-UUID fast-path, exact
id, unique prefix, ambiguous-prefix -> :class:`AmbiguousIdError`) and ADD
case-insensitive **title** matching for human references: an exact title, or —
when nothing matches exactly — a unique title *prefix* (#1786), so a name is as
prefix-resolvable as an id and the surface stays consistent across notebook /
source / note / artifact refs.

Routing is by token shape:

* A full canonical UUID is returned verbatim with **no list call** (so a tool
  invoked with a concrete id never pays for a list).
* A hex-ish token (``^[0-9a-fA-F-]+$``) takes the id/prefix path via
  ``resolve_ref`` against the listed items, then **falls back to the title path**
  if the id/prefix path finds nothing — so an item whose title is all-hex
  (``"beef"``, ``"1234"``) is still reachable by name. An *ambiguous* hex prefix
  raises :class:`AmbiguousIdError` and never falls through to title.
* Anything else takes the title path: a case-insensitive **exact** title match
  wins first; failing that, a case-insensitive unique title **prefix** match.
  0 matches raises the public ``*NotFoundError``; an ambiguous exact title or an
  ambiguous prefix (>1) raises :class:`AmbiguousIdError` carrying the colliding
  ids. Exact wins over prefix, so a title that is also a prefix of a longer one
  (``"Report"`` vs ``"Report Q1"``) resolves to itself rather than reporting
  ambiguity — mirroring the id resolver's exact-over-prefix rule.

Sources are resolved within their notebook's source list. The prefix path's
no-match (``ValidationError`` from ``resolve_ref``) is re-raised as the
domain-specific ``*NotFoundError`` so every miss surfaces uniformly as
``NOT_FOUND`` regardless of which path produced it.

Strict IDs-only mode (``NOTEBOOKLM_MCP_STRICT_IDS=1``, off by default) turns every
resolver below into a full-UUID gate: a name, title, or short id *prefix* is
rejected with :class:`ValidationError` **before any list call**, so a long-lived
automation fails loud and deterministically instead of fuzzy-matching a token
whose meaning can drift (issue #1808). See :data:`STRICT_IDS_ENV`.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` — only the ``_app``
resolve core and the public exception hierarchy.
