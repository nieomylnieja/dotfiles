"""Artifact (Studio) routes — generate / poll / download / list.

Adapters over the transport-neutral generate / download / artifacts cores and
the public ``client.artifacts`` namespace. The generation-kind defaults / option
choices come from the neutral generation core, and download specs are consumed
directly from the canonical ``_app.download_specs`` registry — never imported
from another adapter.

Generation is non-blocking: ``POST .../artifacts`` runs ``execute_generation``
with ``wait=False``, records the returned ``task_id`` in the pending registry,
and returns ``202``. The poll (``GET .../artifacts/{task_id}``) projects the raw
``GenerationState`` through the registry to resolve the same ``NOT_FOUND``
ambiguity as the source poll:

* a registry-known task in any **non-terminal** state → ``200`` (still polling).
  The partition is :attr:`GenerationState.is_terminal`, not an enumeration here,
  so this covers ``PENDING`` / ``IN_PROGRESS`` / ``NOT_FOUND`` (the one-shot
  post-generate lag), the ``UNKNOWN`` and rare ``SUGGESTED`` /
  ``PENDING_REVIEW`` states, and anything added to the enum later;
* ``COMPLETED`` → ``200`` ready (dropped from the registry);
* ``REMOVED`` → ``410`` (sustained terminal absence; dropped);
* ``FAILED`` → ``409`` with the error (dropped);
* an unknown task id → ``404``.

Only terminal states are dropped from the registry: evicting a still-running
task would make its next benign ``NOT_FOUND`` poll ``404`` rather than project
(#2127, which also moved ``UNKNOWN`` onto the non-terminal side).

Download streams the bytes from a **server-generated** ``mkstemp`` path (never a
caller-supplied one — ``build_download_plan`` does not validate path shapes),
then cleans it up.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
