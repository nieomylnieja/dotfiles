"""Pass-through resolvers shared by the REST route adapters.

The transport-neutral ``_app`` executors take injected ``resolve_notebook_id`` /
``resolve_source_id`` / source-list / download resolver callables shaped for the
CLI (which turns a human ``<id|name>`` reference into a canonical id). The REST
server works in full ids end to end, so it hands the executors trivial resolvers
that return the already-resolved id(s) unchanged.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
