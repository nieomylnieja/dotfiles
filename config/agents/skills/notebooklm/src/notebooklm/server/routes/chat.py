"""Chat route — ``POST /v1/notebooks/{id}/chat`` (blocking).

A single blocking ``POST`` that calls ``client.chat.ask`` and returns the full
:class:`~notebooklm.types.AskResult` (answer, references, conversation_id). There
is NO SSE — ``client.chat.ask`` returns a complete answer with no public token
stream, so real-token streaming is deferred until a public streaming surface
exists.

The request rides the client's long ``chat_timeout`` (no short server-imposed
ceiling), tolerant of the RPC-semaphore serialization under concurrency.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
