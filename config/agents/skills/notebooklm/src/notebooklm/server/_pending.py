"""In-process pending-id registry — provenance for poll → 200 vs 404.

``client.sources.get_or_none`` returns ``None`` and ``poll_status`` returns
``GenerationState.NOT_FOUND`` for *both* the benign post-create lag AND a bogus
id — the underlying API cannot tell them apart. So the server cannot honor
"200-pending for the lag, 404 for a never-created id" from the client alone.

This registry remembers, per notebook, the source/artifact ids that *this
server* created. A poll consults it:

* a **registry-known** id whose status is ``None`` / ``NOT_FOUND`` → still
  pending (the caller keeps polling);
* an **unknown** id → ``404`` (the server never created it);
* a known id that reaches a terminal state (``READY`` / ``COMPLETED`` /
  ``REMOVED`` / ``FAILED``) is dropped — the resource is now listable (or gone),
  so subsequent polls resolve from the client directly.

It is **process-lifetime** and **single-tenant**: a restart loses in-flight ids
(a later poll for a still-pending id falls to ``404`` rather than ``200``), which
is acceptable for personal automation (the caller re-lists / re-polls). There is
no ``/jobs`` resource and no persistence.

This module imports NO ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli``.
