"""Canonical writer for ``storage_state.json`` (and sibling credential files).

This module is the **single sanctioned home** for mutations of
``storage_state.json``. It is the only module under :mod:`notebooklm._auth`
permitted to import the ``_atomic_io`` write primitives
(:func:`atomic_write_json` / :func:`replace_file_atomically`) and to perform the
final atomic write of a storage-state file. The boundary is enforced by
``tests/_guardrails/test_storage_writer_boundary.py`` (an AST guardrail plus an
equality-asserted allowlist of every module that imports ``atomic_write_json``).

Intent-shaped API (all synchronous, all serialize on the canonical storage lock,
all write via ``_atomic_io``):

* :func:`merge_cookie_delta` — the CAS delta merge relocated verbatim from
  ``storage.save_cookies_to_storage`` (kept as the monkeypatchable delegate
  seam in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.storage`). It is a **CAS** intent and
  therefore **fails open** on lock unavailability (status quo): availability
  wins, and the snapshot/delta CAS guards keep correctness.
* :func:`update_account_metadata` / :func:`clear_in_band_account` — the in-band
  account writers relocated from :mod:`notebooklm._auth.account`. These are
  **full-file RMW** intents: :func:`update_account_metadata` **fails closed**
  (raises :class:`LockUnavailableError`) because failing open could overwrite a
  concurrent CAS delta; :func:`clear_in_band_account` is best-effort cleanup and
  swallows lock unavailability, matching the pre-refactor semantics.
* :func:`replace_from_remint` — the full cookie-replace re-mint persister for the
  BROWSER-CAPTURE arms (L3 headless-launch + interactive + CDP), relocated from
  the bare ``atomic_write_json`` sites in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.browser_capture`.
  Applies the write-time domain filter internally under the lock, then either
  carries the existing ``notebooklm`` account namespace (``carry_account=True`` —
  the unattended profile-launch arm, closing [capture-1]) or drops the stale
  binding (``carry_account=False`` — the interactive arm, whose CLI adapter
  re-establishes it). **Fails closed** (returns
  :class:`WriteOutcome` with ``lock_unavailable``). Closes [capture-2].
* :func:`persist_minted_jar` — the master-token L4 re-mint persister relocated
  from :mod:`notebooklm._auth.master_token`, routed through ``_atomic_io`` (so it
  gains fsync durability + temp cleanup) while keeping its storage lock and its
  rebind-to-minted-account semantics. b-PR2 adds the write-time domain filter
  here (the L4 unfiltered-persist gap). **Fails closed.**
* :func:`write_master_token` — the ``master_token.json`` writer, now routed
  through ``_atomic_io`` **and** guarded by a bounded sibling lock (it was
  previously lockless). **Fails closed.**

Lock unification (see ADR-0029): the full-file RMW / re-mint intents drop
``filelock`` in favour of the project-internal ``storage._file_lock`` primitive
via a **platform-neutral bounded acquire** (:func:`_acquire_storage_lock`):
a non-blocking probe plus deadline/jitter retry (default 90 s), then the
per-intent failure policy above. The CAS merge keeps the status-quo blocking
``_file_lock_exclusive`` acquire (fail-open). An in-process ``threading.Lock``
keyed per canonical lock-path (ordering: in-process lock -> OS lock) is added in
``storage._file_lock`` itself so threads within one process serialize before the
OS lock; the distinct ``.{name}.rotate.lock`` sentinel is never collapsed into
the storage lock.

The fail-closed writers raise :class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.LockUnavailableError`
(public via ``notebooklm.exceptions`` / the ``notebooklm.auth`` facade). It
subclasses :class:`TimeoutError` — itself an :class:`OSError` — exactly mirroring
the ``filelock.Timeout`` MRO it replaces, so callers' existing
``except OSError`` / ``except TimeoutError`` arms (``_auth/recovery.py`` around
``persist_minted_jar``; the CLI login writers around ``write_account_metadata``)
keep catching a lock failure unchanged; only the exception type and the 10 s→90 s
bound differ.

Permission contract (POSIX): every writer ensures the parent directory is
``0700`` on creation and the file is ``0600`` (the latter via
:func:`atomic_write_json`'s default mode). On Windows we rely on
``%USERPROFILE%`` ACL inheritance.

Outcome types are **value-free by contract**: :class:`WriteOutcome` may carry
only an enum status — never cookie values, state dicts, jar objects, or caught
exceptions.

      is not narrowed further.

      - ``carry_account=True`` (unattended profile-launch arm): the existing

        into the new state, so an in-place re-mint against our own profile no
        longer destroys the account binding ([capture-1]).
      - ``carry_account=False`` (interactive arm, and the CDP no-resolve
        fallback): the stale binding is DROPPED — the user may have signed into a
        different account. On the INTERACTIVE login arm the CLI adapter's
        ``repair_playwright_account_metadata`` re-establishes it immediately
        after the write. On the library / mid-RPC CDP arm there is NO such
        repair, so it lands on the authuser=0 default (repair happens only via
        CLI ``auth refresh``); carrying a stale index blindly would instead
        relocate [capture-1], so authuser=0 is the deliberate safe fallback.

    CDP arm caveat: CDP attaches to the operator's daily Chrome, whose account
    set may not match the stored binding. The CALLER re-resolves the stored email
    against the captured jar (any network lookup happens OUTSIDE this held lock)
    and passes the verdict as ``carry_account``; on no-resolve it passes
    ``carry_account=False`` rather than carry a possibly-misrouting index.

    Args:
        path: Destination ``storage_state.json``.
        captured_state: The (already healed) captured storage-state dict.
        carry_account: Whether to carry the existing account namespace forward.

    """Full cookie replace for the CLI login / import flows, under the storage lock.

    The single sanctioned persist for ``notebooklm login --browser-cookies``,
    ``notebooklm auth refresh --browser-cookies``, and ``notebooklm auth
    import-cookies``. Replaces ``storage_state.json``'s cookies with ``state`` —
    a login is a brand-new session, so cookies are *replaced*, never merged.
    Everything below happens **inside** the canonical storage lock; the writer
    **fails closed** (``LoginWriteOutcome(lock_unavailable)``) so a caller can
    surface/retry rather than race a concurrent keepalive write.

    Under the lock, in order:

    1. **Write-time domain filter.** ``state``'s cookies are run through
       :func:`filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy` (hoisted from the
       #2086 CLI call sites) so sibling-product cookies never reach disk.
       ``include_domains`` / ``include_optional`` carry the CLI opt-ins through;
       the default policy preserves trusted Google roots
       (``*.googleusercontent.com`` / Drive) — main's preserve-trusted-roots
       behaviour. The filter is idempotent, so a caller (import) that pre-filtered
       with the same opts is not narrowed further.
    2. **Post-filter required-cookie revalidation.** ``MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES``
       is re-checked on the FILTERED names. If a required cookie's only copy sat
       on a now-dropped domain, the writer returns
       ``LoginWriteOutcome(required_cookies_dropped, ...)`` and writes NOTHING —
       preserving #2086's contract (the CLI maps this to
       ``CookieValidationFailure(code="COOKIE_VALIDATION_FAILED")`` + ``io.fail(1)``
       + ``not storage_path.exists()``). Both ``missing_required`` and
       ``present_names`` are value-free cookie NAMES.
    3. **Account metadata**, embedded in the same atomic write via the ``account``
       sentinel:

       - :data:`KEEP_ACCOUNT` (default; the import flavour) — carry whatever
         ``state`` already holds in the ``notebooklm`` namespace (import has none,
         so the result carries none). No account key is synthesised.
       - :data:`CLEAR_ACCOUNT` (the refresh default-account login branch) — no
         account binding is written, so stale routing cannot survive.
       - :class:`AccountRecord` (the targeted login branches) — the
         ``{authuser, email}`` binding is embedded, replacing the former separate
         ``write_account_metadata`` step (one atomic write, no partial-failure
         window).
    4. **Opt-in recording.** The resolved ``include_domains`` (and
       ``include_optional``) are recorded in the ``notebooklm`` namespace so a
       future merge-gate narrowing can consult per-profile opt-ins (plan §b.5);
       additive — old readers ignore unknown namespace keys.
    5. **Import backup.** When ``backup=True`` (the import flavour), a pre-overwrite
       ``.bak`` copy of any existing target is taken INSIDE the lock (0600 on
       POSIX) so it cannot race a concurrent keepalive write; its path is returned
       in the outcome.

    Args:
        path: Destination ``storage_state.json``.
        state: The captured / coerced storage-state dict to persist.
        include_domains: ``--include-domains`` opt-in labels (or ``None``).
        include_optional: Persist all optional sibling-product domains (the
            import-cookies flavour).
        account: Account-metadata action (see above).
        backup: Take a pre-overwrite ``.bak`` backup inside the lock (import).
        io_policy: Reserved for a future per-intent lock/IO policy override;
            currently unused (accepted for forward-compatible call sites).
