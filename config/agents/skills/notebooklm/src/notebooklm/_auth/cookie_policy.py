    The homepage GET requires *at least one* of two secondary-binding paths in
    addition to Tier 1:

    - ``OSID`` (recent-sign-in binding), OR
    - ``APISID`` AND ``SAPISID`` (legacy XSSI pair) **AND** bare ``LSID``.

    Without one of those, Google 302s to ``accounts.google.com/v3/signin`` even
    when ``SID`` and ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` are present and otherwise valid.

    The ``LSID`` conjunct is the correction. The original pair-wise ablation
    only varied ``OSID`` and the XSSI pair; because ``APISID``/``SAPISID`` are
    ``.google.com``-scoped they survived every domain filter, so the XSSI branch
    was never tested *without* them and the ``LSID`` dependency stayed hidden.
    A three-way ablation, replicated on two unrelated accounts (2026-08-04,
    issue #1977), gives:

    ==========  =====================  ============  ========
    ``OSID``    ``APISID``+``SAPISID``  bare ``LSID``  result
    ==========  =====================  ============  ========
    present     --                     --            works

    ==========  =====================  ============  ========

    Row 4 is what this function used to get wrong. Two consequences worth
    keeping straight:

    * ``OSID`` alone is sufficient — a profile with **no** ``LSID`` anywhere
      authenticates (row 1, verified with every ``accounts.google.com`` cookie
      stripped). ``LSID`` is required *only* when ``OSID`` is absent.
    * ``__Host-1PLSID`` / ``__Host-3PLSID`` do **not** substitute for bare
      ``LSID``; row 4 retains them and still fails.

    Deliberately domain-blind, and that is not the #2054 mistake. ``LSID`` is
    ``accounts.google.com``-scoped and never routes to the app host, while
    ``OSID`` is app-host-scoped — the binding spans hosts because the auth flow
    does (app-host GET, redirect through accounts, back). A check restricted to
    what routes to the *target* URL would reject working profiles. Host-aware,
    were it ever needed, would mean "``OSID`` routable to the app host, or the
    XSSI pair routable there plus ``LSID`` present for the accounts hop" — not a
    single routed header.

    that rotating ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` could plausibly produce a working

    The difference is the ``LSID`` conjunct. Rotation POSTs to

    """Return the both-hosts caveat to append to "open the app in your browser" advice.

    Every hint that tells a user to open the NotebookLM app in their browser is
    really telling them to *mint the per-product binding cookie* (``OSID`` /
    ``__Secure-OSID``). Google now serves the personal app from two hosts and
    redirects between them, and those binding cookies are **host-scoped**: a
    cookie set on one host is never sent to the other. So the browser visit can
    succeed and still leave the configured host without a binding — which is the
    #2019 shape all over again (a working session read as an expired one).

    Naming a different URL in the advice does not fix that: the redirect happens
    either way. What the user needs is the *outcome* named — which host the
    cookies landed on, which host this client is talking to — plus a recovery
    that works. Hence this note, appended to the binding-related hints.

    Both recoveries are real, and ordered deliberately:

    1. Re-run ``notebooklm login`` and complete the sign-in. That re-mints the
       account-wide cookies. ``APISID`` + ``SAPISID`` live on ``.google.com``
       and ``LSID`` on ``accounts.google.com``, so none of them are host-scoped
       and together they satisfy the binding on *either* host — see
       :func:`_has_valid_secondary_binding`.
    2. Select the host that actually holds the cookies via
       ``NOTEBOOKLM_BASE_URL``.

    Recovery 2 used to carry a caveat marking the rebrand host "experimental —
    not the documented default", asymmetrically so it could never land on the
    legacy host and warn users off the one fallback this project had exercised
    end to end.

    **#2067 retired that caveat rather than inverting it.** The flip made the
    rebrand host the documented default and moved the cassettes onto it, so
    every clause of the old wording became false for it. Re-pointing the same
    words at the legacy host would have been false in the other direction: that
    host is long-exercised, still served, and is now the documented rollback
    lever (ADR-0028, as amended). Neither host is experimental today, so the
    note recommends the sibling without an editorial. Overclaiming in either
    direction sends users into a different failure, which is the bug this note
    exists to avoid.

    Returns:
        The note as plain text (no trailing newline), or ``""`` when the
        configured host has no sibling — i.e. the enterprise host, which has no
        alias, so there is no cross-host scope to warn about.

    - ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` missing + secondary binding missing: ``RotateCookies``
      cannot help because Google rejects requests without the binding cookies.
      User must visit NotebookLM in-browser to populate ``OSID``.
    - Secondary binding missing (Tier-2 warning case): the session works for
      now but is fragile. Visiting NotebookLM populates the missing cookies.

    Every branch names the *configured* host rather than a fixed URL, and the
