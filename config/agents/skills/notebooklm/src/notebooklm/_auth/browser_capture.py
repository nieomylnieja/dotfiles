"""Transport-neutral browser launch, capture, heal, and persistence core.

The shared interactive and headless arms launch a persistent Playwright
context, navigate to the configured app host, capture storage state, apply the
cookie-domain policy, heal PSIDTS when possible, and persist through the native
``ProfileStore`` replacement. The alternative CDP arm uses the same landing,
filter, heal, and persistence rules against an operator-provided browser.

Presentation and exit policy stay behind :class:`BrowserCaptureIO`; Playwright
is imported lazily so the module remains importable without the browser extra.
Only ``interactive=True, headless=False`` and ``interactive=False,
headless=True`` are supported. Automatic headless recovery remains opt-in via
``NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1``.

ADR-0033 folded the login-wait trace and captured-state heal bridge into this
module. ``browser_launch_errors.py`` remains a cohesive pure classifier leaf and
is re-exported here for the CLI boundary.

    paying for a cold-start heal. The bridge adapts only the ``httpOnly``

    """Capture NotebookLM storage state by attaching to a running Chrome over CDP.

    An **alternative credential source** for layer-3 headless re-auth: instead
    of launching a dedicated persistent-context browser against our profile
    dir, attach (``playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp``) to a Chrome the
    operator is *already* running and pointed us at via an explicit CDP
    endpoint. The motivation is freshness: a user's daily Chrome is
    continuously Google-refreshed, whereas our dedicated profile can go stale in
    the long-idle case — so the live browser is a stronger re-mint source.

    This arm performs the SAME landing classification as the headless launch
    arm (:func:`run_browser_capture` with ``headless=True``): navigate to the
    NotebookLM base URL, and if it does not land on the configured host, raise
    :class:`HeadlessLoginRequiredError` (the typed honest signal the caller
    maps to FAILED) rather than hang. On success it captures
    ``BrowserContext.storage_state()``, applies the same cookie-domain
    allowlist, and atomically persists ``storage_state.json``.

    **EXPLICIT / opt-in only.** ``cdp_url`` is an endpoint the operator
    provides; this never auto-discovers a browser. **LOCAL-UNATTENDED-ONLY** —
    a CDP endpoint is account-equivalent and this is NOT a remote / hosted MCP
    auth path; the local-only host check is enforced upstream in
    ``resolve_cdp_url`` (loopback hosts only). **Never logs a cookie value or
    the endpoint** (only the typed outcome).

    **Lifecycle (CRITICAL):** the attached Chrome belongs to the operator. We
    reuse its EXISTING browser context (which carries the live Google session)
    — never ``new_context`` (a fresh context would be logged out) — and create
    a TEMPORARY page we own for the navigation, closing ONLY that page in
    ``finally`` so the operator's own tabs are never navigated or closed.
    Teardown then only **disconnects** the Playwright client (``browser.close()``
    on a CDP-connected browser severs the connection without killing the user's
    Chrome). If the attached browser exposes no context, we fail loudly rather
    than fabricate one.

    Args:
        plan: Capture plan; ``browser`` / ``browser_profile`` are ignored on
            this arm (we attach to a running browser, not a profile dir), while
            ``storage_path`` / ``include_domains`` are honored identically.
        io: Side-effect sink. The headless caller injects a silent / raising
            sink; ``emit`` lines are dropped and never carry a cookie value.
        cdp_url: The operator-provided CDP endpoint (e.g.
            ``http://127.0.0.1:9222``) of an already-running Chrome started with
            ``--remote-debugging-port``.

    Returns:
        A :class:`CaptureResult` (``page_html`` best-effort, may be ``None``).

    Raises:
        HeadlessLoginRequiredError: the attached browser did not land on the
            NotebookLM host (its Google session cannot reach NotebookLM).
