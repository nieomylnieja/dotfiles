"""Transport-neutral browser launch -> capture -> filter -> persist core.

This module owns the *neutral* heart of the Playwright login flow: it launches a
persistent-context browser against a profile dir, navigates to the configured
NotebookLM base URL, waits for the session to land on that host, forces the
``.google.com`` cookies for regional users, captures
``BrowserContext.storage_state()``, applies the cookie-domain allowlist, and
atomically persists ``storage_state.json``. It carries no Click / Rich / CLI
coupling — presentation, interactive prompting, account-selection, exit-code
policy, and human-readable error hints stay in the CLI adapter
(:mod:`notebooklm.cli.services.playwright_login`) per ADR-0021. The few moments
the core must surface a line or abort are inverted behind the
:class:`BrowserCaptureIO` Protocol (the same shape as the CLI's ``LoginIO``),
so a headless caller can inject a silent / raising sink.

**Shared core for two callers.** This is the single launch/capture/persist
primitive used by BOTH:

1. the interactive ``notebooklm login`` Playwright flow
   (``interactive=True, headless=False`` - a human completes Google SSO in a
   visible browser); and
2. the layer-3 headless re-auth flow
   (``interactive=False, headless=True``): when NotebookLM cookies are dead but
   a persistent browser profile still holds a live Google session, drive a
   headless browser to silently re-mint cookies.

Headless re-auth is explicit by default via
``client.refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)``; a mid-RPC auto-fire happens only
when ``NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1`` is set in the environment. The
``headless`` / ``interactive`` parameters and their branch points are live for
those two supported modes; any other combination is rejected by
:func:`_reject_unsupported_mode`.

``playwright`` is imported lazily (function-local) so importing this module
without the ``browser`` extra never fails — mirroring the deferral the CLI flow
has always used.

    """Capture NotebookLM storage state by attaching to a running Chrome over CDP.

    An **alternative credential source** for layer-3 headless re-auth: instead
    of launching a dedicated persistent-context browser against our profile
    dir, attach (``playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp``) to a Chrome the
    operator is *already* running and pointed us at via an explicit CDP
    endpoint. The motivation is freshness: a user's daily Chrome is
    continuously Google-refreshed, whereas our dedicated profile can go stale in
    the long-idle case — so the live browser is a stronger re-mint source.

    This arm performs the SAME landing classification as the headless launch
    arm (:func:`run_browser_capture` with ``headless=True``): navigate to the
    NotebookLM base URL, and if it does not land on the configured host, raise
    :class:`HeadlessLoginRequiredError` (the typed honest signal the caller
    maps to FAILED) rather than hang. On success it captures
    ``BrowserContext.storage_state()``, applies the same cookie-domain
    allowlist, and atomically persists ``storage_state.json``.

    **EXPLICIT / opt-in only.** ``cdp_url`` is an endpoint the operator
    provides; this never auto-discovers a browser. **LOCAL-UNATTENDED-ONLY** —
    a CDP endpoint is account-equivalent and this is NOT a remote / hosted MCP
    auth path; the local-only host check is enforced upstream in
    ``resolve_cdp_url`` (loopback hosts only). **Never logs a cookie value or
    the endpoint** (only the typed outcome).

    **Lifecycle (CRITICAL):** the attached Chrome belongs to the operator. We
    reuse its EXISTING browser context (which carries the live Google session)
    — never ``new_context`` (a fresh context would be logged out) — and create
    a TEMPORARY page we own for the navigation, closing ONLY that page in
    ``finally`` so the operator's own tabs are never navigated or closed.
    Teardown then only **disconnects** the Playwright client (``browser.close()``
    on a CDP-connected browser severs the connection without killing the user's
    Chrome). If the attached browser exposes no context, we fail loudly rather
    than fabricate one.

    Args:
        plan: Capture plan; ``browser`` / ``browser_profile`` are ignored on
            this arm (we attach to a running browser, not a profile dir), while
            ``storage_path`` / ``include_domains`` are honored identically.
        io: Side-effect sink. The headless caller injects a silent / raising
            sink; ``emit`` lines are dropped and never carry a cookie value.
        cdp_url: The operator-provided CDP endpoint (e.g.
            ``http://127.0.0.1:9222``) of an already-running Chrome started with
            ``--remote-debugging-port``.

    Returns:
        A :class:`CaptureResult` (``page_html`` best-effort, may be ``None``).

    Raises:
        HeadlessLoginRequiredError: the attached browser did not land on the
            NotebookLM host (its Google session cannot reach NotebookLM).
