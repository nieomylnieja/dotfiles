"""Keepalive ``RotateCookies`` poke helpers for authentication.

This private module hosts the rotation throttle + POST that
``notebooklm.auth`` previously owned at module level. ``notebooklm.auth`` keeps
re-exporting compatibility names, but production no longer mirrors facade-level
rebindings; tests that substitute keepalive internals should patch this
canonical module directly.

Logger name is pinned to ``"notebooklm.auth"`` (NOT ``__name__``) so existing
``caplog`` assertions targeting ``notebooklm.auth`` keep matching the records
emitted from the moved bodies.

# Google's __Secure-1PSIDTS / __Secure-3PSIDTS cookies are the rotating freshness
# partners of __Secure-1PSID / __Secure-3PSID. Their server-side validity window
# is short (minutes-to-hours scale) and Google only emits a rotated value when
# the client asks the identity surface to rotate. Pure RPC traffic against
# the app host never triggers rotation, so a long-lived storage_state
# silently stales out and every subsequent call fails with the
# "Authentication expired or invalid" redirect (see issue #312).
#
# We POST to ``accounts.google.com/RotateCookies`` — the dedicated rotation
# endpoint Chrome itself calls for legacy cookie rotation. Empirically validated
# against both DBSC-bound (Playwright-minted) and unbound (Firefox-imported)
# profiles in #345: a single POST returns 200 and sets fresh
# ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` / ``__Secure-3PSIDTS`` for either session type. The
# response body declares the next-rotation interval (`["identity.hfcr",600]` —
# 10 minutes), which sets the floor for how often this is worth firing.

#   loop X cannot be safely awaited from loop Y. Multiple ``asyncio.run()``
#   invocations in the same process, or worker threads each running their
#   own loop, would otherwise trip ``RuntimeError`` or leave waiters in
#   inconsistent state.
#
# The outer registry is a ``WeakKeyDictionary`` keyed on the loop *object* (not
# its ``id()``): when a loop is garbage-collected, its inner dict is reclaimed
# automatically. This bounds the lock cache for hosts that repeatedly create
# short-lived loops, and avoids the ``id()``-reuse hazard where a closed loop's
# stale lock could be returned to a new loop that happens to allocate at the
# same address.

#      two layer-2 keepalive loops on the same profile, or a layer-1 +
#      layer-2 pair on different event loops) can each read a stale 0.0

    Failures are logged at DEBUG and swallowed: this is purely a freshness
    optimisation. The caller's request to the app host is the
    authoritative health check.

    Three layered guards keep the POST from stampeding ``accounts.google.com``:

    1. **Disk mtime fast path.** If ``storage_state.json`` was rewritten within
       the rate-limit window, skip without any locking. Covers the common
       sequential-CLI case at zero cost.
    2. **In-process ``asyncio.Lock``.** Inside the lock, re-check the disk
       mtime (a sibling task may have rotated and saved during the wait) and
       a monotonic in-memory timestamp (a sibling may have rotated but not
       yet saved). Together these dedupe an ``asyncio.gather`` fan-out so
       only one POST fires per process per rate-limit window.
    3. **Cross-process non-blocking flock.** When ``storage_path`` is set, try
       to acquire ``.storage_state.json.rotate.lock`` with ``LOCK_NB``. If
       another process holds it, skip — they're rotating right now. This
       handles ``xargs -P``, parallel MCP workers, and similar parallel
       launches without queueing.

       Known gap: the flock is released as soon as the POST returns, but the
       caller's storage-state save happens *after* this function returns. A
       second process that starts in that narrow window observes the still-
       stale on-disk mtime and an unheld flock, and will fire its own POST.
       Worst case is two pokes back-to-back across processes — bounded, not
       a stampede. Closing this fully would require holding the flock past
       ``_poke_session`` until the save completes, which would entangle this
