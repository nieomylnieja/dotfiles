"""Layer-3 headless re-auth: silently re-mint dead NotebookLM cookies.

This is the **deepest** auth-recovery layer. When NotebookLM's first-party
cookies (``SID`` / ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` / …) are fully dead — the homepage GET
302s to ``accounts.google.com`` and even L1 token refresh and L2 PSIDTS
rotation cannot help — the user's persistent *browser profile* may still hold a
live Google SSO session (it outlives ``storage_state.json``). L3 drives a
**headless** browser against that profile to re-mint NotebookLM cookies without
a human, then lets the normal auth path retry.

Recovery layering (deepest last):

* **L1** — token / CSRF refresh (homepage GET re-extracts ``SNlM0e`` /
  ``FdrFJe``; :func:`notebooklm._auth.session.refresh_auth_session`).
* **L2** — ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` rotation via the ``RotateCookies`` POST
  (:mod:`notebooklm._auth.keepalive` / :mod:`notebooklm._auth.psidts_recovery`).
* **L3** — headless browser re-auth (this module). Fired only after L1/L2
  cannot help, and only when explicitly allowed.

**Locked design decision (inherited from the P1 browser-capture core).**
Headless re-auth is EXPLICIT by default via
``client.refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)``; a mid-RPC auto-fire happens
ONLY when ``NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1`` is set in the environment. L3 never
auto-fires by default. With no opt-in and no profile the behavior is
byte-identical to the pre-L3 terminal "Run 'notebooklm login'" path.

**SECURITY — local-unattended-only.** The persistent browser profile is an
**account-equivalent credential**: a live Google session, longer-lived than
``storage_state.json``. L3 must NOT become the auth story for a remote / hosted
MCP server — it is for a local, unattended agent/worker on the operator's own
machine. It reuses the existing cookie-domain allowlist
(:func:`notebooklm._auth.browser_capture.filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy`)
on the captured ``storage_state`` and widens neither credential storage nor
logging (never logs a captured cookie value — only the typed outcome).

**Honest, typed outcomes.** Unlike a sibling project that silently returns
``None``, this layer distinguishes three states and NEVER reports success on
dead tokens:

* :attr:`HeadlessReauthStatus.UNAVAILABLE` — L3 could not even be attempted
  (opt-in off, ``playwright`` not installed, or — on the default profile arm —
  no reusable profile).
* :attr:`HeadlessReauthStatus.FAILED` — L3 ran but the credential source's
  Google session is ALSO dead (the browser landed off the NotebookLM host),
  or the capture otherwise failed.
* :attr:`HeadlessReauthStatus.SUCCESS` — fresh cookies were captured, filtered,
  and atomically persisted to ``storage_state.json``.

**Alternative credential source — CDP attach.** Besides launching the dedicated
profile, L3 can attach to an operator-pointed already-running Chrome over the
Chrome DevTools Protocol (``cdp_url`` /
:data:`NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL_ENV`), via
:func:`notebooklm._auth.browser_capture.run_cdp_capture`. This mitigates the
dedicated-profile-can-stale weakness — the operator's daily Chrome is
continuously Google-refreshed. It is EXPLICIT / opt-in (an endpoint the operator
provides, never auto-discovered), reuses the SAME landing classification and the
SAME cookie-domain allowlist, and stays under the SAME local-unattended-only
boundary (a CDP endpoint is account-equivalent; never a remote / hosted MCP auth
path, never logs a cookie value or the endpoint).

``playwright`` stays lazily imported (only the neutral capture core touches it);
importing this module without the ``browser`` extra never fails.

@dataclass
class _DriveRecord:
    """Per-(storage path, credential source) drive-coalescing state for the headless browser drive.

    The in-process coalescing primitive for one ``storage_state.json``. It
    bundles the drive lock that serializes browser drives with the typed
    outcome of the most recent COMPLETED drive, stamped with a monotonic
    drive-sequence number (``completed``). Followers coalesce on that typed
    outcome — never on file mtime — so a sibling write that merely touches the
    storage file can never be mistaken for a successful re-mint.

    **Why this is NOT** :mod:`notebooklm._auth.single_flight`. An earlier
    version of this docstring promised the opposite — that the structure was
    kept self-contained "so a later shared single-flight core can reuse it
    wholesale". That core landed (ADR-0030 c-PR2) and this record did not adopt
    it. The promise was wrong, not merely unfulfilled, and is retired here.

    ``single_flight`` coalesces callers that each have a RUNNING EVENT LOOP:
    ``claim()`` calls ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` to create the leader
    ``asyncio.Task``. This drive has no loop at its coalescing point and
    structurally cannot get one. :func:`attempt_headless_reauth` is a SYNC
    entry, and its only production caller deliberately runs it *off* the loop —
    ``asyncio.to_thread(attempt_headless_reauth, ...)`` in
    :func:`notebooklm._auth.recovery.try_headless_reauth` — because the browser
    drive blocks. Inside that worker thread ``claim()`` raises ``RuntimeError:
    no running event loop`` (measured, not inferred; pinned by
    ``test_single_flight_is_unreachable_from_the_sync_drive_entry``).

    Neither escape route is free:

    * **Spin a throwaway loop** (``asyncio.run``) inside the sync entry just to
      reach ``claim()``. This coalesces correctly in a spike, but it makes the
      documented sync entry raise ``RuntimeError: asyncio.run() cannot be
      called from a running event loop`` for any caller that invokes it from
      inside a coroutine, and it spends a fresh
      event loop plus a second thread hop per browser drive (loop → to_thread →
      new loop → to_thread → blocking drive) to replace one ``threading.Lock``.
    * **Hoist the claim** into the async ``recovery.try_headless_reauth``. That
      narrows one thing this record exists for and complicates another.
      (1) *Coverage*: every PRODUCTION path already funnels through
      ``recovery.try_headless_reauth``, so a hoisted claim would still coalesce
      all of them. What it drops is the SYNC entry's own coalescing for direct,
      loop-less callers — today that is its whitebox tests
      (``test_concurrent_explicit_attempts_coalesce_to_one_browser``) and any
      future non-``recovery`` caller. The entry is private
      (``notebooklm._auth``, fenced off from the CLI by ``test_cli_boundary``),
      so that residual is small but real. (2) *Keying*: the ``source``
      discriminator (``"profile"`` vs ``"cdp"``) is resolved INSIDE
      :func:`attempt_headless_reauth` by :func:`resolve_cdp_url`, which also
      enforces the LOCAL-UNATTENDED-ONLY loopback boundary — ``recovery`` would
      have to CALL that gate itself to build a correct flight key (it is a pure
      module-level function, so this is a call, not a reimplementation — the
      real residual is that a rejected non-loopback endpoint resolves to
      ``None``, so the rejection warning would move), or
      collapse the two sources into one key (the exact cross-source false-FAILED
      bug the per-``(path, source)`` key fixes; see :func:`_get_drive_record`).

    For the record, what ``single_flight`` would NOT have broken: the typed
    closed-enum outcome rides a flight future unchanged; nothing jar-bearing is
    retained either way (a :class:`HeadlessReauthResult` carries status, reason
    and a path — no credential); and the [capture-3] stale-outcome guarantee is
    structural there too, since ``claim`` joins only a not-yet-done flight and
    prompt-pops settled ones. The blocker is the event loop, not the contract —
    so this record stays, with its own state lock and its own sequence, as the
    THREAD-level coalescer that ``single_flight``'s task-level model cannot be.

# callers serialize on a per-resolved-path drive lock, and a follower coalesces

# completed *during its own wait* — instead of launching a redundant browser.
#
# **Coalescing keys on the leader's outcome, never on file mtime.** An earlier
# design skipped the follower's browser when it observed the storage file's
# mtime advance while it waited. That was a false-SUCCESS hazard: an *unrelated*
# writer (a keepalive / PSIDTS rotation) advancing the same file's mtime made a
# follower report SUCCESS even when the leader's re-mint actually FAILED — the
# user then hit a confusing downstream auth error instead of the honest "Run
# 'notebooklm login'" path. Followers now accept only the leader's *typed*
# :class:`HeadlessReauthResult`, stamped with a monotonic drive-sequence
# number, and only when that sequence advanced during the wait.
#
# **Snapshot-before-wait (the in-process analogue of the #816 rule).** A
# follower snapshots the completed-drive count BEFORE blocking on the drive
# lock and accepts an outcome only from a *strictly-newer* completed drive. A
# stale outcome from a PREVIOUS drive cycle (cookies may have re-died since)
# reads as "no outcome", so the follower drives its own browser. A follower
# that cannot observe a fresh leader outcome (crashed leader, stale record)
# also drives its own — a redundant browser is SAFE, a false SUCCESS is NOT.

    Decision logic (the gate the locked design decision pins):

    1. **Opt-in.** Proceed only when ``allow_headless`` is ``True`` OR
       ``NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH=1`` is set. Otherwise return ``UNAVAILABLE``
       — L3 NEVER fires by default. (Callers pass ``allow_headless=True`` for
       the explicit ``client.refresh_auth(allow_headless=True)`` entry, and
       gate the mid-RPC auto-fire on the env var via
       :func:`headless_reauth_env_enabled`.)
    2. **Playwright present.** The ``browser`` extra must be importable;
       otherwise ``UNAVAILABLE`` (nothing to drive).
    3. **Credential source.** Two alternative sources, both opt-in:

       * **CDP attach** (when ``cdp_url`` resolves, explicit arg or
         :data:`NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL_ENV`): attach to an
         operator-pointed already-running Chrome
         (:func:`notebooklm._auth.browser_capture.run_cdp_capture`). The
         dedicated profile is NOT required on this path — the live browser is
         the credential source. This is the freshness mitigation for our
         dedicated-profile-can-stale weakness.
       * **Dedicated profile** (default): a persistent profile dir holding a
         (hopefully live) Google session must exist on disk
         (:func:`_resolve_reusable_profile`); no profile → ``UNAVAILABLE``.

    4. **Drive the headless browser**: navigate to the NotebookLM base URL,
       classify the landing — authenticated (lands on NotebookLM) → capture /
       domain-filter / atomically persist; redirected off-host → the source's
       Google session is ALSO dead → :class:`HeadlessLoginRequiredError` →
       ``FAILED`` (loud, never hangs). Both sources reuse the SAME landing
       classification and the SAME cookie-domain allowlist.

    This function performs the *recovery*, not the retry. On ``SUCCESS`` the
    caller re-runs the normal auth path (L1 token refresh) which now finds the
    freshly-persisted cookies. It is a recovery, not the hot path. Browser
    drives are coalesced in two places: mid-RPC callers join
    ``AuthRefreshCoordinator.await_refresh``'s loop-bound single-flight, and
    every caller of THIS function — including the bare-thread ones that have no
    event loop — serializes per ``(storage path, credential source)`` in
    :func:`_drive_capture_coalesced`. That second one is deliberately not
    :mod:`notebooklm._auth.single_flight`; :class:`_DriveRecord` records why.

    Args:
        storage_path: ``storage_state.json`` to (re)write on success.
        allow_headless: Explicit opt-in (the ``refresh_auth(allow_headless=)``
            value). When ``False``, only the env var can enable L3.
        browser_profile: Explicit persistent-profile dir; defaults to the
            profile's ``get_browser_profile_dir`` when ``None``.
        profile: Profile name used to resolve the browser-profile dir.
        browser: Playwright channel (``"chromium"`` / ``"chrome"`` / ``"msedge"``).
        include_domains: Optional cookie-domain opt-in labels, forwarded to the
            same allowlist filter the interactive login uses.
        cdp_url: Optional explicit CDP endpoint of an already-running Chrome to
            attach to instead of launching the dedicated profile. ``None``
            falls back to :data:`NOTEBOOKLM_HEADLESS_REAUTH_CDP_URL_ENV`. When
            resolved, the CDP arm runs and the dedicated profile is not
            required. EXPLICIT / opt-in, LOCAL-UNATTENDED-ONLY.
        env: Environment mapping for the opt-in + CDP-URL checks; defaults to
            :data:`os.environ`.
