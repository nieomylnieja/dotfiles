"""The v0.x profile-persistence compatibility facade.

Concrete profile transactions live in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.profile_store`;
legacy account composition lives in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.profile_migration`;
and sealed commits live in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.credential_io`. This module
retains historical signatures, result identities, lock aliases, cookie CAS
adapters, and direct-call shims without owning a second persistence path.

All synchronous intents serialize through the typed credential spine:

* :func:`merge_cookie_delta` — the compatibility adapter behind
  :func:`save_cookies_to_storage`. It is a **CAS** intent and therefore **fails
  open** on lock unavailability (status quo), delegated to ``ProfileStore``.
* :func:`update_account_metadata` / :func:`clear_in_band_account` — the in-band
  account writers relocated from :mod:`notebooklm._auth.account`. These are
  **full-file RMW** intents: :func:`update_account_metadata` **fails closed**
  (raises :class:`LockUnavailableError`) because failing open could overwrite a
  concurrent CAS delta; :func:`clear_in_band_account` is best-effort cleanup and
  swallows lock unavailability, matching the pre-refactor semantics.
* :func:`replace_from_remint` — the v0.x full cookie-replace compatibility
  wrapper. Browser capture now consumes :class:`ProfileStore`'s native
  ``ReplaceResult`` directly; this adapter preserves the old value-free
  :class:`WriteOutcome`. **Fails closed.**
* :func:`replace_from_login` — the v0.x login/import compatibility wrapper. It
  translates account sentinels to primitive directives, invokes the native
  operation, and projects its ``ReplaceResult`` to ``LoginWriteOutcome``.
  **Fails closed.**
* :func:`persist_minted_jar` — the master-token L4 compatibility adapter; the
  path-owned store now owns its fail-closed replacement transaction.
* :func:`write_master_token` — the ``master_token.json`` writer, now routed
  through ``_atomic_io`` **and** guarded by a bounded sibling lock (it was
  previously lockless). **Fails closed.**

Compatibility outcome types are **value-free by contract**:
:class:`WriteOutcome` may carry only an enum status — never cookie values,
state dicts, jar objects, or caught exceptions.

    If auth was loaded from an environment variable (no file), this is a no-op.

    Cross-process safety: the read-merge-write cycle is wrapped in an OS-level

      back-compat shim, not a scheduled deprecation, so the advisory is a
      ``RuntimeWarning`` and is not silenced by ``NOTEBOOKLM_QUIET_DEPRECATIONS``).
      Kept only as a public-API back-compat shim for callers outside this repo;

        return_result: Internal escape hatch for callers that need CAS-rejected

            the default bool return.

        prevented the save or a CAS guard preserved a sibling-process write.

    Closes the Appendix A2 stale-overwrite-fresh and path-collapse hazards:

    - **Deltas (CAS-guarded for keys in the snapshot)**: cookies in the
      jar whose snapshot tuple (``value, expires, secure, http_only``)
      differs from ``original_snapshot`` are written to disk **only if**
      the on-disk value still matches the snapshot value. If disk has
      rotated since open time, a sibling process has written it; we
      preserve their write rather than clobber it with our local
      rotation. New cookies acquired during the session are written only
      when no same-key storage row exists yet; an existing row means a
      sibling acquired the same cookie first. Comparing the full snapshot
      tuple keeps attribute-only refreshes (same value, new ``expires``)
      flowing to disk, but CAS remains value-only because attribute-only
      sibling drift is routine session metadata and should not wedge later
      value rotations.
    - **Deletions (CAS-guarded)**: a key present in the snapshot but
      absent from the jar is dropped from disk **only if** the on-disk
      value still matches the snapshot value — symmetric with the
      value-update CAS above. An ``Max-Age=0`` that evicted our
      locally-expired copy must not erase the sibling's freshly-issued
      replacement.
    - **Untouched**: cookies in the jar whose tuple matches the snapshot
      are not written, so a sibling-process write to the same key
      survives. Cookies on disk that are not in the snapshot are also
      left alone (they belong to a sibling process or another path).
