"""Inline ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` recovery for the cookie-load preflight (issue #865).

Background:

``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` is the rotating freshness partner of ``__Secure-1PSID``.
It is minted reliably only by the dedicated ``accounts.google.com/RotateCookies``
POST that the keepalive loop in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.keepalive` uses. The
Playwright login flow substitutes two passive ``goto()`` navigations, which
Google does not always answer with ``Set-Cookie: __Secure-1PSIDTS``. When that
happens, ``storage_state.json`` is saved without PSIDTS, the Tier-1 preflight
in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.cookie_policy` rejects the next CLI invocation, and
the keepalive recovery path (which would heal the state in one POST) is
unreachable because it only runs inside an opened ``NotebookLMClient`` — a closed loop.

The header comment on ``MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES`` has always described PSIDTS
as ``directly accepted by Google's homepage check, OR recoverable via the
RotateCookies POST when other auth cookies are intact``. This module wires the
recoverable arm of that policy into the cold-start load path: when ``SID`` is
present and a valid secondary binding (``OSID``, or ``APISID + SAPISID``) is
intact but PSIDTS is missing, fire one ``RotateCookies`` POST, persist the
rotated cookies to disk via the existing snapshot/delta save, and let the
preflight retry.

The hard-Tier-1 classification of PSIDTS in ``MINIMUM_REQUIRED_COOKIES`` is
intentionally preserved so any caller that bypasses :func:`_recover_psidts_inline`
still sees a strict reject. Future work (option B, tracked separately): demote
PSIDTS to Tier 2 outright and rely on a session-open prime to mint it before
the first RPC. That change touches the lifecycle ordering and is out of scope
for this fix.

    NOT reuse it: that predicate models the caller's preflight instead, and the
    two disagree in ways that matter (see its docstring).

    Only ``__Secure-1PSIDTS`` rows are converted. Restricting by name *before*
    conversion is not just an optimization: ``http.cookiejar.Cookie.__init__``
    coerces eagerly (``int(float(expires))``), so a malformed ``expires`` on any
    unrelated sibling row would otherwise raise from inside a predicate that
    callers invoke from within an ``except ValueError:`` handler. Narrowing the
    conversion surface to the rows the question is actually about keeps the
    blast radius minimal, and the answer is identical either way because
    ``http.cookiejar`` evaluates each cookie independently.

    A row whose ``expires`` cannot be coerced (``""``, ``"never"``, ``nan``,
    ``inf``, a list) is skipped: an unconvertible row cannot be put in a jar, so
    it cannot be sent, so it must not hold the heal back. Recovery then fires,
    which is the safe direction — one throttled POST versus an unhealed session.

    Duplicate ``(name, domain, path)`` identities are resolved CONSERVATIVELY:
    an identity routes only when *every* row carrying it is unexpired.
    ``http.cookiejar`` keeps one cookie per identity — ``set_cookie`` assigns
    ``_cookies[domain][path][name]`` against the LITERAL domain string, with no
    leading-dot normalization — and lets a later row replace an earlier one, so a
    jar built from a duplicated identity depends on entry order, precisely the
    order-sensitivity this gate exists to remove. Poisoning from any dead row is
    order-independent *and* never over-optimistic, at the cost of a needless POST
    when a stale duplicate shadows a fresh one. A row that fails conversion has
    no identity and therefore cannot poison one.

    Note the identity tuple is deliberately NOT the leading-dot-equivalent key
    from :func:`notebooklm._auth.cookies._cookie_key_variants`. That equivalence
    exists for the disk CAS/merge stage; here it would manufacture a false
    negative, because ``.google.com`` and ``google.com`` both route yet the jar
    keeps them as two independent cookies, so a stale one would poison a fresh
    one the jar still sends.

    Args:
        entries: Raw cookie dicts (storage_state entries or rookiepy rows).
        to_cookie: Converter matching ``entries``' shape.
        now: Injectable wall-clock seconds for deterministic tests; defaults to
            the current time via :meth:`http.cookiejar.Cookie.is_expired`.

    Yields:
        One cookie per surviving identity, in first-seen identity order. The
        IDENTITY SET is order-independent; both the sequence and *which*
        duplicate occurrence is yielded are not — last-write-wins means
        ``[fresh_a, fresh_b]`` yields ``fresh_b`` and the reverse yields
        ``fresh_a``. Harmless while the only consumer reads a boolean, but a
        future consumer that takes the first element, or reads a cookie's
        VALUE, would reintroduce order-sensitivity.

    This is the "did the heal land?" question, and it models the caller's
    RETRIED PREFLIGHT — not the request jar. That preflight
    (:func:`notebooklm._auth.cookie_policy._validate_required_cookies`) is
    domain-blind name presence. Asking the rotate-URL question here would report
    "not healed" for a PSIDTS persisted only on the app host, re-raising an
    authentication error over a session that actually works — a false negative
    in the direction that hurts (issue #2057).

    Deliberately a plain existential, NOT the jar model in
    :func:`_iter_routable_psidts_cookies`. Two rules from there are wrong here,
    and both cause the same harmful false negative:

    - **No duplicate-identity poisoning.** A stale twin sharing a row's
      ``(name, domain, path)`` does not stop a name-presence preflight from
      passing. Poisoning here is not merely pessimistic, it is a PERMANENT
      failure loop: ``save_cookies_to_storage`` CAS-matches the first stored row
      and leaves the stale twin on disk, so every subsequent load would fire a
      POST, write to disk, then re-raise "Missing required cookies" for a
      session whose preflight passes. The twin is issue #1523's data shape;
      #1523 fixed the producer, and nothing on the load/save path removes an
      existing one.
    - **An unparseable ``expires`` counts as PRESENT.** The row is on disk and
      the preflight will see it. This mirrors the predecessor gate, which
      treated an uninterpretable expiry as present rather than guessing.

    It IS deliberately stricter than the preflight in two respects, both in the
    safe direction:

    - a row known to be expired does not count, though the preflight ignores
      ``expires`` entirely. Dropping that would regress issue #1273 — a no-op
      save over a stale on-disk row would report success and fake a heal.
    - a row with an empty ``value`` does not count, though
      :func:`~notebooklm._auth.cookies.extract_cookies_from_storage` gates on
      name alone. Unreachable in practice: the POST writes a real value, and
      :func:`_build_recovery_jar` skips valueless rows anyway.

    The invariant to hold is an implication, not an equality: live ⇒ the
    preflight passes on the PSIDTS half (it says nothing about ``SID``). "The
    preflight" here means
    :func:`~notebooklm._auth.cookies.extract_cookies_from_storage`, the
    name-presence loader. The sibling loader
    ``_build_httpx_cookies_from_storage_strict`` converts every row and can
    still reject a state this accepts, because a row whose ``expires`` will not
    coerce raises there — a pre-existing gap in the shared loader, tracked
    separately, not something this predicate can close.

    Note routable ⇒ live still holds, since a routable row is unexpired,
    allowlisted and non-empty — which is what makes the fused "healed by another
    process" return in :func:`_recover_psidts_inline` sound.

      genuinely absent and otherwise returns what the loader returned before
      #2061.
    * heal succeeded — the rotation already proved a routed cookie and persisted
      a live row, so re-asking the routing question would only re-litigate it.
      The single retry cannot recurse into recovery.

    The pure loaders stay network-free by construction; every recovery side
