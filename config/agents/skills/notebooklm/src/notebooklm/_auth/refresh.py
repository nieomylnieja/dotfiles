        The refresh command inherits the **full parent environment** (so it

          client-registry file). None of these is needed by a refresh command,
          and none should leak down the process tree.
        * ``_NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_ATTEMPTED`` is injected as the recursion guard.
        * ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_PROFILE`` / ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_STORAGE_PATH``
          are injected so the command refreshes the right profile in place.

        SECURITY: only the first-party secrets above are scrubbed. We
        deliberately do **not** impose a hard allowlist, because a refresh
        command commonly re-invokes this library and legitimately needs much of
        the inherited env. As a consequence, **any other secret in the
        launching shell** (e.g. ``GOOGLE_*`` tokens, CI secrets, API keys — and
        any token the operator embeds in ``NOTEBOOKLM_REFRESH_CMD`` itself) is
        inherited by the refresh command and every grandchild it spawns, and is
        visible via ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` to the same UID. Operators MUST NOT
        keep unrelated secrets in the environment that launches the refresh
        command; scope secrets to the processes that need them.

        SERVER CONTEXT: this function can now fire MID-SESSION inside a
        long-lived REST/MCP server (the L2.5 rung — see
        :func:`try_refresh_cmd_reauth`). Scrubbing the server's own auth
        secrets (``NOTEBOOKLM_SERVER_TOKEN`` etc.) closes the path by which a
        mid-session refresh would otherwise hand the server's credential to an
        operator-supplied subprocess. The redaction of captured stdout/stderr
        (below) likewise limits what a mid-session refresh writes to logs.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the refresh command is missing, parses to an empty
            argv, is malformed (unterminated quote), times out, or exits
            non-zero.

            index when known.

            requested account index 0. Implicit default-account calls leave the
            URL byte-identical to pre-multi-account behavior.

            entirely. The passive read-only validation path
