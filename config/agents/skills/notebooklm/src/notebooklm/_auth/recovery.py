# Cross-loop coalescing of both the cold ladder and the L4 master-token re-mint
# now flows through ``notebooklm._auth.single_flight`` (c-PR2). The old per-loop
# in-flight task registries (``_COLD_INFLIGHT_BY_LOOP`` /
# ``_MASTER_INFLIGHT_BY_LOOP``) and the hand-rolled ``_await_shared_task``
# settle loop were deleted in the same PR.
#
# The two structures that remain here are CONSUMER-SIDE policy, deliberately NOT
# promoted to the cross-loop core (plan §c.1):
#   * ``_COLD_LOCKS_BY_LOOP`` — a per-loop asyncio.Lock serializing the ladder
#     across rung policies on one loop.
#   * ``_COLD_SUCCESS_GENERATIONS`` — the per-loop revalidate-on-bump epoch: a
#     fresh loop that already succeeded revalidates against the network before
#     re-running the full ladder. Promoting this to cross-loop would change the
#     fresh-loop-runs-full-ladder behavior, so it stays per-loop here.
