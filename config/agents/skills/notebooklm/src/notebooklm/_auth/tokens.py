    Attributes:
        cookies: Required Google auth cookies keyed by ``(name, domain, path)``
            per RFC 6265 §5.3 (issue #369). Legacy 2-tuple ``(name, domain)``
            and flat ``name -> value`` shapes are still accepted on
            construction and widened to the path-aware shape by
            :func:`normalize_cookie_map` during ``__post_init__``. This is a
            public compatibility/bootstrap shadow: the kernel copies it once
            during client composition and no first-party post-open decision
            reads it. Docs-only deprecated since v0.8.1 for removal in v1;
            runtime warnings would make synthesized dataclass operations noisy.
        csrf_token: CSRF token (SNlM0e) extracted from page
        session_id: Session ID (FdrFJe) extracted from page
        storage_path: Path to the storage_state.json file, if file-based auth was used
        cookie_jar: Domain-preserving public compatibility/bootstrap shadow.
            The kernel copies it once during client composition, then owns the
            sole mutable jar used for HTTP, routing, recovery, and persistence.
            Managed-client code must use the kernel jar, not this field.
            Docs-only deprecated since v0.8.1 for removal in v1.
        authuser: Google ``authuser`` index this profile authenticates as.
            ``0`` (the default account) is used when no in-band account
            metadata is present in ``storage_state.json``, matching
            pre-multi-account behavior. A pre-v0.5.0 profile's account
            metadata in the legacy sibling ``context.json`` is derived into
            in-band shape on load (and promoted in-band durably by a detached
            retryable single-flight) — see ``notebooklm._auth.storage`` — rather than read
            from here.
        account_email: Stable Google account identity for routing. When set,
            NotebookLM requests use it as the ``authuser`` value instead of the
            integer index, because Google account indices can change when other
            accounts sign out.
        cookie_snapshot: Internal save baseline used when a pre-client token
            fetch mutates cookies but persistence fails or CAS-rejects. This
            lets the eventual client retry the unpersisted delta instead
            of snapshotting the already-mutated jar as clean state.

           Scheduled for removal in v1. Use managed-client request APIs, which
           select from the kernel-owned live jar.

        This is the domain-correct way to build a raw header. Cookie selection
        follows RFC 6265 §5.4 via :attr:`cookie_jar`, so a cookie scoped to one
        host is not sent to another — unlike :attr:`cookie_header`, which
        collapses every domain into one name→value slot and therefore has to
        pick an arbitrary winner when the same name exists on two hosts
        (issue #2054).

        ``url`` is required and deliberately has no default: a default would
        reintroduce the fabricated target that this method exists to remove.

        .. important::
           Routing is only as good as the jar. An ``AuthTokens`` built from a
           bare ``name -> value`` mapping has no domains to preserve, so
           ``__post_init__`` widens every entry to ``.google.com`` and this
           method returns the **same broadcast header for every host** — the
           behaviour it exists to replace, without an error to say so. Build
           from ``storage_state`` (``AuthTokens.from_storage``, or pass
           ``storage_path``) to get real per-host selection.

        Args:
            url: Absolute URL the header is being built for. Must be ``https``:
                selection is ``Secure``-aware, so an ``http`` URL either drops
                the ``Secure`` cookies without saying so or — for a jar built
                from a bare cookie map, where nothing is marked ``Secure`` —
                hands back credentials for a cleartext request. Both are wrong
                for auth, so the scheme is rejected instead.

        Returns:
            Semicolon-separated ``name=value`` pairs, or ``""`` when no stored
            cookie matches ``url``.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``url`` is not an absolute ``https`` URL with a host,
                or if this session has no cookie jar. Every failure here is
                raised rather than returned as ``""``: an empty header is
                indistinguishable from "no cookie matched", which is a legitimate
                answer, so a silent empty string would hide a malformed URL
                (``https:/typo`` parses fine and matches nothing) behind a
                plausible-looking result.

        .. note::
           Not a pure query: ``http.cookiejar.add_cookie_header`` ends by calling
           ``clear_expired_cookies()``, so reading a header can prune expired
           entries from :attr:`cookie_jar`. Harmless today — pruning changes what
           the jar *holds*, never what a request *sends*, and Playwright writes
           session cookies as ``expires: -1`` (mapped to ``None``, never expired),
           so the eligible population is normally empty.

           **Revisit if this method ever gains a caller inside**
           ``AuthTokens.from_storage``: between ``snapshot_cookie_jar`` and
           ``save_cookies_to_storage`` a prune would be persisted to disk as a
           deletion. Correct in itself, but it would make a read-shaped call a
