"""DEBUG tracing for the interactive login wait — pure leaf of ``browser_capture``.

``notebooklm -vv login`` used to print nothing at all for the whole five-minute
``page.wait_for_url`` block, so a login that never landed (e.g. Google's
``notebook.google.com`` rebrand) was indistinguishable from a user who simply
walked away from the browser. Issues #2017 / #2022 / #2023 / #2025 / #2028 /
#2030 / #2032 each needed manual triage that a single "navigated to X" line
would have answered. See #2046.

This module owns the Playwright-event side of that tracing so the capture core
stays under the ADR-0008 module-size budget. It is a leaf: it imports only the
credential-stripping URL formatter (:func:`trace_url`) and stdlib, holds no
state, and has no CLI / Click / Rich coupling (ADR-0021).

    outside a small Google-OAuth allowlist, on the reasoning that the path tells
    an operator which endpoint failed.

    That trade is wrong here. This formatter renders **arbitrary main-frame
    navigations observed during a live SSO flow**, and a Workspace tenant can
    federate to any identity provider — ``https://idp.example/sso/<assertion>``
    puts a one-time credential straight in the path of a host no allowlist can
    anticipate. `-vv` output is exactly what our issue template asks users to
    paste into public bug reports, so the safe default is to keep nothing but
    the host.

    Nothing is lost: the entire diagnostic this tracing exists to provide is
    *which host the browser is on* — "waiting for notebook.google.com, landed
    on notebooklm.google.com". The path never contributed to that answer.
