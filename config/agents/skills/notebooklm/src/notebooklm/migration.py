"""Migration from legacy flat layout to profile-based directory structure.

Handles transparent migration of ~/.notebooklm/ files into
~/.notebooklm/profiles/default/ on first CLI invocation.

The migration is:
- Automatic: triggered by ensure_profiles_dir() on CLI startup
- Idempotent: safe to run multiple times
- Crash-safe: uses copy-then-delete with marker file; each copy lands via
  temp-name + atomic rename, so a crash mid-copy can never leave a torn
  file/dir at its final destination name
- Non-destructive: originals kept until all copies succeed
- Single-writer: cross-process ``filelock`` serializes concurrent CLI
  invocations so a container start-up race cannot interleave copies.
