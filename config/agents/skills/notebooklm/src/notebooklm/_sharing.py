        This is an **upsert**, not an add: an email that is not shared yet is

        That is the backend's own behaviour — confirmed live — and it is why the

        this method rather than distinct operations.

        ``notify`` and ``welcome_message`` apply to the whole call, not per grant.

        first-wins or last-wins rule to honour — sending one would be a lie.

        The comparison is **exact**, matching what was actually probed (the same
        address twice). Addresses differing only in case are left alone: RFC 5321
        makes the local part case-sensitive, only the domain is not, so folding
        case here would reject two addresses the server may well treat as
        distinct identities. If they do resolve to one account they hit the same
        silent no-op the backend already has; establishing that needs a live
