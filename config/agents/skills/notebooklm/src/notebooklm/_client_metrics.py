"""Observability metrics helper for the NotebookLM client runtime.

Owns the cumulative ``ClientMetricsSnapshot`` counters, the threading lock that
guards them, and the optional ``on_rpc_event`` telemetry callback. The metrics
surface has one home (this file) instead of being woven into the runtime
composition root alongside drain, reqid, and auth state.

Design constraints (load-bearing — see ``tests/unit/test_swallow_observability.py``
and ``tests/unit/test_observability.py``):

* ``__init__`` MUST be event-loop-agnostic — it constructs only a
  ``threading.Lock`` and a plain dataclass. Never call
  ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` or instantiate any ``asyncio.*`` primitive
  here. ``NotebookLMClient`` is routinely built outside a running loop.

* :meth:`emit_rpc_event` MUST stay ``async def`` and ``await
  maybe_await_callback(...)``. The await is the back-pressure mechanism: a
  slow user-supplied callback intentionally throttles the RPC path. Do NOT
  switch to ``asyncio.create_task`` (fire-and-forget) or a custom
  ``asyncio.iscoroutine`` branch — both would break that contract.

* Exceptions raised by the user callback are swallowed and logged at WARNING.
  The categorized-swallow contract in ``test_swallow_observability.py`` covers
  similar sites; do NOT add new log lines on this path.

    Owns three pieces of state:

    * ``_metrics_lock`` — ``threading.Lock`` guarding all reads/writes of the
      snapshot. Threading (not asyncio) because the snapshot is also touched
      by sync helpers like ``metrics_snapshot`` and because ``record_*`` calls
      from RPC paths must work whether or not a loop is running.
    * ``_metrics`` — the cumulative :class:`ClientMetricsSnapshot`. Replaced
      atomically under the lock via ``dataclasses.replace`` so external readers
      always see a consistent snapshot.
    * ``_on_rpc_event`` — the user-supplied telemetry callback, or ``None``.
      Read at emit time so test fixtures can swap it after construction.

    Field names (``_metrics_lock``, ``_metrics``, ``_on_rpc_event``) are
    kept stable for grep-discoverability across the test suite.
