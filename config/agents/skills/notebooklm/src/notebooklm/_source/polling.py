    """Report the failure actually observed at the deadline, not merely "time ran out".

    Tolerating a transient ERROR (see ``_TRANSIENT_ERROR_TYPES``) is a
    *hypothesis*: an audio or still-unclassified source may report status=3
    briefly while it is being transcribed/classified, so the poll keeps going
    rather than failing fast. Sustained ERROR right up to the deadline is what
    disproves it — the source did not fail to answer, it answered ERROR, over
    and over, until we gave up. Calling that a timeout misdiagnoses it.

    This is the #2138 ``.wav`` route. A WAV uploads cleanly (bytes transfer
    fine) and processing then ends at ``status=ERROR`` with ``type_code=0``,
    which is in the transient list — so the poll tolerated it to the deadline
    and raised :class:`SourceTimeoutError`, and nothing anywhere named the
    processing failure. Callers reasonably read a timeout as "still working, ask
    again later" and retry forever.

    **"Sustained" is load-bearing, and ``error_streak`` is what measures it.**
    A deadline is caller-chosen and can be short: ``wait_until_ready(timeout=2)``
    on a source that is legitimately mid-transcription may get exactly one look,
    see ERROR, and expire — and that source may still reach READY seconds later.
    Reporting it as a terminal processing failure would be a fabricated verdict,
    the mirror image of the bug this fixes. So the conversion requires
    :data:`_MIN_SUSTAINED_ERROR_POLLS` *consecutive* ERROR observations ending
    at the deadline; anything less stays a timeout, which is the honest answer
    when all we know is that the budget ran out. The streak resets on any
    non-ERROR observation, so a source that was PROCESSING and only flipped to
    ERROR on the final tick is a timeout too.

    Both types are :class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.SourceError`, and every
    consumer in this repo already handles them side by side (``_app``'s
    ``SourceWaitOutcome`` buckets, the MCP ``_waitagg`` mapper, ``notebooklm
    source wait``'s exit codes), so this changes which bucket the ``.wav`` case
    lands in — from "timed out, try again" to "failed" — rather than adding an
    unhandled shape.

    The elapsed budget stays in the message: "ERROR throughout a 120 s poll" and
    "ERROR across two ticks of a 3 s poll" are different claims, and the reader
    needs to know which one this is.
