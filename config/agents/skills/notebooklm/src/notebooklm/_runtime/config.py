"""Module-level constants for the NotebookLM client runtime.

Holds the ``DEFAULT_*`` knobs that historically lived in the
``notebooklm._core`` preamble (the compatibility shim was removed in
v0.5.0). Callers import directly from this module — e.g.
``from notebooklm._runtime.config import DEFAULT_TIMEOUT``.

These values are tuned for typical interactive workloads; see each docstring
below for guidance on when an operator would want to override them via the
