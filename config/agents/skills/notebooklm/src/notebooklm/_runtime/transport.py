"""Authed POST transport collaborator — the middleware-chain leaf.

``RuntimeTransport`` owns the three pieces of the authed POST hot path
(history: docs/refactor-history.md):

* :meth:`RuntimeTransport.terminal` — the middleware-chain leaf. Sends
  the populated :class:`RpcRequest` via :meth:`Kernel.post` and maps the
  raw transport errors into the ``Transport*`` exception shapes consumed
  by ``RetryMiddleware`` / ``AuthRefreshMiddleware``.
* :meth:`RuntimeTransport.refresh_request_for_current_auth` — re-builds
  the envelope from ``RPC_CONTEXT_BUILD_REQUEST`` if a concurrent refresh
  moved the auth snapshot between materialization and the terminal POST.
* :meth:`RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post` — the entry point the
  RPC executor / chat path call. Runs the
  loop-affinity guard, captures the current auth snapshot, materializes
  the request envelope, dispatches it through the wired middleware
  chain, and records the semaphore queue-wait latency.

:class:`MiddlewareChainHost` owns the chain leaf
(:meth:`MiddlewareChainHost._authed_post_chain_terminal`), the chain
slot (``chain_host._authed_post_chain``), and the three retry-budget
tunables (``_rate_limit_max_retries`` / ``_server_error_max_retries`` /
``_refresh_retry_delay``). ``perform_authed_post`` does not read the
retry-delay directly — the retry/backoff budget for the refresh path
is owned by ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` and by
``RpcExecutor.try_refresh_and_retry``, both of which read
``chain_host._refresh_retry_delay`` live through provider lambdas wired
in ``_runtime.init.wire_middleware_chain``. Integration tests that
assign ``client._composed.chain_host._refresh_retry_delay = 0`` keep
steering the live delay.

Construction order in :func:`compose_client_internals`:
:func:`notebooklm._runtime.init.build_runtime_transport` constructs the
transport **before** :func:`wire_middleware_chain`. The wired chain
leaf is :meth:`MiddlewareChainHost._authed_post_chain_terminal` (a
one-line forward to :meth:`RuntimeTransport.terminal`) — wiring through
the host preserves the canonical fixture-rebind seam (tests that
swap the chain leaf or the chain itself rebind on the host directly).
The chain itself is reached by the transport through an injected
``chain_provider`` closure that reads
``chain_host._authed_post_chain`` live, late on every
:meth:`perform_authed_post` call; this both breaks the construction
cycle and preserves the long-standing test pattern of reassigning
``core._composed.chain_host._authed_post_chain`` to install a fake chain. The
:class:`AuthRefreshCoordinator` snapshot is reached via an injected
``snapshot_provider`` callable so :class:`RuntimeTransport` never has
to hold a direct back-reference to the composition root.

        """Rebuild the envelope from the current auth snapshot before every POST.

        This guard is **load-bearing**: it runs on *every* terminal attempt
        (including retries driven by ``RetryMiddleware`` for 429 / 5xx) and
        unconditionally rebuilds ``RpcRequest.url`` / ``.headers`` / ``.body``
        from a freshly captured :class:`AuthSnapshot` whenever
        ``RPC_CONTEXT_BUILD_REQUEST`` is present. The unconditional rebuild
        is the runtime correctness fix for the stale-envelope path that
        existed when the freshness check short-circuited on snapshot
        equality:

        1. Initial attempt: snapshot ``S_old`` is captured by
           :meth:`perform_authed_post`, the envelope is materialized, and
           the request enters the chain.
        2. Terminal POSTs and the response is HTTP 401.
        3. :class:`AuthRefreshMiddleware` (just inside ``RetryMiddleware``)
           catches the auth error, refreshes credentials, mutates
           ``request.context[RPC_CONTEXT_AUTH_SNAPSHOT]`` to ``S_new``
           in-place (see
           :meth:`AuthRefreshMiddleware._rebuild_request_after_refresh`
           for the contract — that mutation is the carrier of the new
           snapshot across the ``Retry`` ↔ ``AuthRefresh`` boundary), and
           hands a freshly built ``retry_request`` to the chain leaf.
        4. The retry attempt POSTs with the refreshed envelope and the
           response is HTTP 429.
        5. The 429 propagates back up to ``RetryMiddleware`` (outside
           ``AuthRefreshMiddleware``), which retries by re-invoking the
           chain with the **original** ``RpcRequest`` from step 1. That
           request's ``.url`` / ``.headers`` / ``.body`` were built from
           ``S_old`` even though its shared ``context`` dict now carries
           ``S_new`` (mutated in step 3).
        6. Without an unconditional rebuild here, a snapshot-equality
           short-circuit would compare ``S_new`` (in context) against
           ``S_new`` (freshly captured), declare "no change," and send the
           stale ``S_old`` envelope. The unconditional rebuild keeps
           ``URL`` / ``headers`` / ``body`` aligned with
           :attr:`Kernel._client.cookies` (which carries the refreshed
           cookie jar) for every attempt.

        Idempotence on the happy path: when no refresh ran, the snapshot
        captured here equals the snapshot used by
        :meth:`perform_authed_post`, so the rebuilt envelope is
        byte-identical to the inbound one. The extra ``build_request``
        invocation per attempt is the cost of the freshness invariant.

        AST guarded — see
        :func:`tests.unit.test_concurrency_refresh_race.test_terminal_freshness_check_has_no_await_after_materialization`
        which reads the source of this method to assert no ``await``
        follows :func:`materialize_rpc_request`. Any restructuring here
        must keep that invariant: the snapshot and the rebuilt envelope
        must be produced together with no suspension point between them
        so a concurrent refresh cannot move the cookie jar between the
        rebuild and :meth:`Kernel.post`.
