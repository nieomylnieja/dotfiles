"""Construction-time helpers for the NotebookLM client composition root.

Splits the client-runtime constructor into three concerns:
:func:`validate_constructor_args` (kwarg validation + normalization),
:func:`build_collaborators` (the seven collaborators in dependency order),
and :func:`wire_middleware_chain` (the seven-middleware ADR-0009 chain).
Dependency-ordering and seam-resolution comments live inside the helpers so
future readers see *why* the order matters.

Builds on the constructor-DI work in #1027 (``36dcc634`` —
"refactor(session): constructor DI for late-bound test seams; drop
http_client.setter"), which eliminated the late-binding wrappers and
the ``Kernel.http_client.setter`` and made ``decode_response`` /
``sleep`` / ``is_auth_error`` / ``async_client_factory`` the canonical
injection seams.

``None``-default resolution for ``sleep`` is owned by
:mod:`notebooklm._client_seams`; ``async_client_factory`` resolves directly to
``httpx.AsyncClient`` here.
