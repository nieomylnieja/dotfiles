"""Auth refresh coordinator helper for the client runtime.

Owns the auth refresh state machine and snapshot serialization:

* ``_refresh_lock`` — single-flight lock guarding refresh-task creation. Lazy
  because ``asyncio.Lock()`` needs a running loop in some Python versions and
  the coordinator can be constructed outside one.
* ``_refresh_task`` — the shared in-flight refresh task. Slot is intentionally
  preserved across waiter cancellation so siblings can still join, and is
  replaced only on the next refresh wave once the existing task hits
  ``done()`` (see :meth:`await_refresh` docstring).
* ``_refresh_callback`` — the user-supplied async callable that performs the
  actual refresh. ``None`` disables refresh-on-401.
* ``_auth_snapshot_lock`` — serializes the four-scalar reads in
  :meth:`snapshot` with the two-scalar writes in :meth:`update_auth_tokens`
  so RPC snapshots cannot observe a torn ``(csrf, session_id)`` pair while
  refresh is in flight. Intentionally distinct from ``_refresh_lock``:
  mixing them would re-introduce the reentrancy ambiguity that
  snapshot-side serialization was added to avoid.

Design constraints (load-bearing — see tests/unit/test_refresh_*.py and
tests/integration/concurrency/test_refresh_cancellation_propagation.py):

* ``__init__`` MUST be event-loop-agnostic — it stores only a plain callable
  and ``None`` placeholders. Never call ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` or
  instantiate ``asyncio.*`` primitives at construction time.
* :meth:`await_refresh` MUST hold no lock across ``await self._refresh_callback()``.
  The refresh lock gates *task creation* only; the await on the task itself
  happens outside the lock so other waiters can join. Mixing this contract
  would silently deadlock waiters on a slow callback.
* :meth:`update_auth_tokens` writes ONLY ``auth.csrf_token`` and
  ``auth.session_id`` under the snapshot lock. It does NOT touch the
  http client. The cookie-jar sync is a separate concern handled by
  :meth:`update_auth_headers` (sync, no await — it runs the
  ``kernel.cookies`` read outside any auth lock). That sync is public
  compatibility-only; first-party decisions already read the kernel jar.
* The ``_refresh_task`` slot is intentionally NOT cleared when a waiter is
  cancelled mid-shield — concurrency tests assert task identity across
  cancellation so siblings joined to the same single-flight refresh see the
  same completion.

Collaborator surface:

The coordinator depends on explicit per-method collaborators:
:meth:`snapshot` and :meth:`update_auth_tokens` take an
``auth: AuthTokens`` kwarg, :meth:`update_auth_headers` takes
``auth: AuthTokens`` plus ``kernel: Kernel``, and the lock-wait metric is
recorded through ``self._metrics`` (already supplied at construction).
This keeps every dependency on the coordinator's surface concrete and
narrow.

          stays non-raising in the normal racing case.

        Slot-preservation invariant (CRITICAL — load-bearing): the
        ``self._refresh_task`` slot is INTENTIONALLY left intact after a
        cancel. Sibling waiters joined to the same single-flight refresh
        (see :meth:`await_refresh` and the ``asyncio.shield`` it wraps
        around the join) read the slot to identify the shared task; clearing
        it here would break the concurrency invariant pinned by
        ``tests/unit/test_runtime_auth.py::test_await_refresh_cancellation_preserves_task_slot``.
        The slot is replaced only on the NEXT refresh wave once the current
        task transitions to ``done()`` — never here, never in close.

        Behavior is equivalent to:

            refresh_task = host._auth_coord._refresh_task
            if refresh_task is not None and not refresh_task.done():
                refresh_task.cancel()
                await asyncio.gather(refresh_task, return_exceptions=True)

        Regression coverage:
        ``tests/unit/concurrency/test_session_close_refresh_race.py`` and
        the three focused unit tests added with this method in
        ``tests/unit/test_runtime_auth.py`` (the two companion
        ``reset_after_open`` tests for :class:`TransportDrainTracker` live
        in ``tests/unit/test_runtime_lifecycle.py``).
