"""Type-only contracts shared across feature APIs.

This module defines the narrow structural Protocols feature APIs depend
on. Per ADR-0013, a Protocol lives here only when **shared by ≥2
features**; single-consumer capabilities stay local to their owning
feature module (e.g. ``AuthMetadata`` lives in ``_source/upload.py`` and
``OperationScopeProvider`` lives in ``_artifact/polling.py``, each with a
single consumer).

Contents:

* :class:`Kernel` — pure transport surface consumed by the upload
  pipeline (and structurally satisfied by the concrete ``Kernel``).
* :class:`RpcCaller` (~17 consumers) and :class:`LoopGuard` (2
  consumers) — the surviving shared capability Protocols that meet the
  ADR-0013 ≥2-feature bar.

Feature APIs that need more than one capability take their direct
collaborators by keyword-only constructor argument (``ChatAPI`` in
``_chat/api.py``, ``ArtifactsAPI`` in ``_artifacts.py``, and
``SourceUploadPipeline`` in ``_source/upload.py``). The feature-local
composite Protocols ``ArtifactsRuntime`` and ``UploadRuntime`` (and
their corresponding adapter dataclasses) that previously bundled three
capability Protocols apiece were retired once it was clear they only
hid three stable collaborators with exactly one production satisfier.
The single-consumer ``AuthMetadata`` / ``OperationScopeProvider`` and
the unused ``AsyncWorkRuntime`` composite were inlined / deleted in
issue #1327 for the same reason — a Protocol with fewer than two
production consumers is indirection that no production code varies.
