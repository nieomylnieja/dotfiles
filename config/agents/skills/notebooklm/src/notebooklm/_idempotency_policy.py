    # Active classifications — side effects and notebooks
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # These entries replace the UNCLASSIFIED placeholders for mutating RPCs whose
    # side-effect semantics are well-understood and stable. The full
    # audit decision matrix lives in ADR-0005
    # (``docs/adr/0005-idempotency-taxonomy.md``); the short version follows.
    #
    # CREATE_NOTEBOOK
    #   Mutating create with an executable wrapper in ``NotebooksAPI.create``:
    #   the caller captures a title/baseline probe before issuing the RPC and
    #   retries only after probing for a committed notebook. Classification:
    #   ``PROBE_THEN_CREATE`` so raw ``rpc_call(CREATE_NOTEBOOK, ...)`` disables
    #   blind transport retries too.
    #
    # DELETE_NOTEBOOK / DELETE_SOURCE / DELETE_ARTIFACT
    #   Server-side delete is idempotent: replaying the request after a 5xx /
    #   network failure yields the same final state (the resource is gone).
    #   Classification: ``IDEMPOTENT_SET_OP``. The transport retry loop keeps
    #   running unchanged — today's behavior is preserved, the registry simply
    #   documents *why* it is safe.
    #
    # REFRESH_SOURCE
    #   Refresh kicks off a server-side fetch job. A duplicate refresh job is
    #   harmless (extra bandwidth, same eventual content) but observable, so
    #   the caller has accepted at-least-once semantics. Classification:
    #   ``AT_LEAST_ONCE_ACCEPTED``. The transport may retry; the registry
    #   emits a rate-limited WARN so operators can see the trade-off when it
    #   actually fires.
    #
    # SHARE_NOTEBOOK
    #   Mutates the shared-users / public-access ACL. A blind retry after a
    #   network blip can re-send invitation emails (with ``notify=True``) or
    #   flip access between RESTRICTED / ANYONE-WITH-LINK twice. The codebase
    #   does expose a server-side probe RPC (``GET_SHARE_STATUS``) that can
    #   list the current ACL, so the *correct* policy is ``PROBE_THEN_CREATE``
    #   — the transport must NOT retry blindly, and a future wrapper can
    #   ``get_status()`` to decide whether the prior call landed before
    #   re-issuing. Today only the classification is in place (which suppresses
    #   the blind retry); the caller-side probe-then-create wrapper is a
    #   follow-up.

    # Active classifications — ADD_SOURCE + ADD_SOURCE_FILE
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #
    # ADD_SOURCE is variant-shaped: the call site distinguishes ``"url"`` (web /
    # YouTube), ``"drive"`` (Google Drive document), and ``"text"`` (pasted
    # content). Each variant has a different retry-safety profile because the
    # server-side dedupe key differs:
    #
    # * ``"url"`` — probe by ``source.url == url`` on a notebook list, filtered
    #   against a baseline of source ids captured before the create: a URL is
    #   NOT unique within a notebook, so an unfiltered match could hand back a
    #   pre-existing source and report a create that never landed (#2204). The
    #   probe is a single GET_NOTEBOOK; the wrapper retries the create once if
    #   the probe finds nothing. PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
    # * ``"drive"`` — probe by ``source.drive_document_id == file_id``, the
    #   Drive ``documentId`` echoed back in the source metadata, filtered
    #   against the same kind of pre-create baseline (a ``documentId`` is not
    #   unique within a notebook either; #2113). Drive rows carry no URL at
    #   all, so the ``/d/<file_id>``-in-``source.url`` probe this replaced
    #   could never match. Same wrapper as ``"url"``. PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
    # * ``"text"`` — no reliable dedupe key (titles non-unique, body not
    #   exposed in the source list). NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY: force-disable the
    #   inner transport retries and let the first failure surface so the caller
    #   can decide. See the ``add_text`` rationale in
    #   ``tests/integration/concurrency/test_idempotency_create.py:17-19``.
    #
    # ADD_SOURCE_FILE is single-shape: it registers a file source by name.
    # Filenames are NOT identity-bearing (two uploads of ``report.pdf`` are
    # legitimately two distinct sources), so the per-API wrapper captures a
    # baseline of source IDs *before* the create attempt and filters probe
    # matches to "new since the create started" sources only. Ambiguous
    # matches (>1 new source with the same filename) raise rather than guess.
    # PROBE_THEN_CREATE.
    #
    # These entries force-disable blind transport retries via
    # ``resolve_effective_disable_internal_retries``. The per-API call sites in
    # ``_source/add.py`` / ``_source/upload.py`` own the executable probe loop for
    # the URL, Drive, and file variants.
