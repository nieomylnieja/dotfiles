"""Stable request payload builders for the account-level *collection* RPCs.

A collection is a source-``Label`` of type ``3`` with **no notebook parent**, so
these builders reuse the four label RPCs (``I3xc3c`` / ``agX4Bc`` / ``le8sX`` /
``GyzE7e``) with three wire differences vs. :mod:`notebooklm._label.params`
(owner-captured on the live Gemini-Notebook UI, issue #2006):

1. ``notebook_id`` (label slot ``[1]``) is ``None`` — collections are
   account-level, not notebook-scoped.
2. A type discriminator ``3`` rides in the **last** slot of every request.
3. The request-options wrapper (arg ``[0]``) ends in ``[1, 3]`` instead of the
   label wrapper's ``[1]``.

Every builder returns a **fresh** structure per call so callers never alias a
shared mutable wrapper (cf. :func:`notebooklm._label.params._opts`).
