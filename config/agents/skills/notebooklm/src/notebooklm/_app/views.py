"""Transport-neutral output-projection views (enum→label, debug-blob strip).

Where a wire result would otherwise leak raw protocol integers or a debug blob,
these helpers project the typed domain object into an agent-readable dict. They
are the single home for projections the MCP tools historically hand-rolled, so
the CLI/MCP/REST adapters all emit the SAME enriched shape (Option B — lift the
projection into ``_app`` rather than copy it per adapter):

* :func:`share_status_view` — ``ShareStatus`` with string-labeled access /
  permission / view_level enums (a raw :func:`to_jsonable` pass would leak
  ``access=1`` etc.).
* :func:`source_view` — a ``Source`` with string ``kind`` / ``status_label`` /
  ``drive_status_label`` labels and the ``is_drive_degraded`` verdict added
  alongside the raw ``status`` / ``_type_code`` / ``drive_status`` integers.
* :func:`notebook_view` — a ``Notebook`` with a string ``role_label`` added
  alongside the raw ``role`` integer.
* :func:`notebook_viewed_keys` — the ``last_viewed_at`` timestamp plus its
  deprecated ``modified_at`` alias key, for the hand-built CLI JSON envelopes
  that do not go through :func:`notebook_view`.
* :func:`ask_result_view` — an ``AskResult`` serialized with the internal
  ``raw_response`` debugging blob stripped (it just burns agent context; the
  field stays on the dataclass, it is only omitted from the wire).

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).

    hardcodes ``FULL_NOTEBOOK``), so shipping it from a read would be

    ``max_individuals_share_limit`` and ``is_public_sharing_allowed`` are
