"""Transport-neutral session-context business logic.

This is the Click-free core of ``cli/services/session_context.py``: it owns the
``use`` verify-and-resolve workflow, the ``status`` read+project computation, and
the ``auth logout`` filesystem-teardown executor. Every transport adapter (the
Click CLI today, the FastMCP server / future HTTP surface tomorrow) drives this
core and renders the typed result into its own surface + exit-code policy.

Three boundary-imposed seams are worth calling out:

* **The partial-notebook-id resolver is injected, never imported.**
  ``cli.resolve.resolve_notebook_id`` reaches into ``rich`` consoles for its
  "Matched: ..." diagnostic, so this module cannot import it without breaking
  the ``_app`` boundary. :func:`verify_and_set_notebook` takes a
  ``resolve_notebook_id`` callable; the CLI wrapper passes its own (read at call
  time so the historical ``monkeypatch`` seam keeps landing).
* **The path/context helpers are injected via bundles, never imported.** The
  ``status`` read needs ``get_context_path`` / ``get_current_notebook`` /
  ``get_path_info``; the ``logout`` teardown needs the resolved storage path,
  ``get_browser_profile_dir``, and the ``clear_context`` callable. These are
  passed in :class:`StatusInputs` / :class:`LogoutInputs` bundles (the
  :class:`~notebooklm._app.doctor.DoctorPaths` pattern) so this core never
  reaches into ``notebooklm.paths`` / ``cli.context`` and the CLI's
  ``patch("...session_context.get_context_path")`` /
  ``patch("...session_context.clear_context")`` test seams keep landing (the CLI
  reads the helpers off its own service-module namespace at call time and
  forwards them here).
* **All rendering + exit-code policy stays in the CLI.** This core returns typed
  dataclasses only; the Rich tables and the green/yellow success lines live in
  ``cli/_session_render.py``.

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).
