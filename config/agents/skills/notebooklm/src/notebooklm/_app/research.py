"""Transport-neutral research status + wait business logic.

This is the Click-free core of the ``research`` command group's ``status`` and
``wait`` flows (distinct from ``source add-research``, which lives in
``_app/source_research.py``). It owns:

* :func:`poll_and_classify` → typed :class:`ResearchStatusResult` for
  ``research status`` (a single non-blocking poll classified into the render
  fields + the canonical ``--json`` public dict);
* :class:`ResearchWaitPlan` / :class:`ResearchWaitResult` /
  :func:`execute_research_wait` — the ``research wait`` orchestration (resolve →
  wait-for-completion → optional import), discriminated by ``outcome``; and
* :func:`validate_research_wait_flags` — the ``--cited-only`` requires
  ``--import-all`` check, raising the public
  :class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.ValidationError`.

This core returns only typed results — the ``--json`` envelope projection
(``sources_found`` / ``imported`` / ``cited_only`` keys) lives in the CLI
renderer, not here, so ``_app`` never replicates an adapter serializer.

Every transport adapter (the Click CLI today, the FastMCP server / future HTTP
surface tomorrow) drives this core and renders the typed result / raises into
its own surface + exit-code policy. The notebook-id resolver, the
(rich-coupled) source importer, and the wait-spinner context are **injected**
as callables so this module never imports the Click/Rich-coupled
``cli.resolve`` / ``cli.research_import`` helpers; the CLI adapter supplies the
live collaborators and preserves the ``import_research_sources`` /
``resolve_notebook_id`` patch seams.

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).
