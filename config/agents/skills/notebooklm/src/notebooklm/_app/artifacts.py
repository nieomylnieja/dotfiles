"""Transport-neutral artifact business logic.

This is the Click-free core of ``cli/artifact_cmd.py``: it owns the behaviour the
artifact ``get`` / ``rename`` / ``delete`` / ``export`` / ``poll`` / ``wait`` /
``retry`` commands share — kind-aware mind-map dispatch, not-found raising, the
typed generation-status DTO, and the export workflow — and returns **typed**
dataclasses (or raises the public ``notebooklm.exceptions`` hierarchy) instead of
an adapter-shaped envelope dict. Each adapter (the Click CLI today, the FastMCP
server / future HTTP surface tomorrow) renders the typed result into its own
vocabulary; the CLI adapter rebuilds its historical ``--json`` envelope from
these fields.

Design seams worth calling out:

* **The ``list`` / ``get`` ``--json`` envelope build stays in the CLI.** The list
  command's Rich-table rows + emoji ``type`` display + ``notebook_title``
  envelope-extra are pure presentation (``cli/rendering.py`` /
  ``cli/services/listing.py``); the artifact-row ``--json`` projection itself is a
  presentation serializer, so it stays with the adapter rather than being
  replicated here. The neutral layer contributes the *behaviour* (kind-aware
  dispatch, not-found raising, the status DTO), and the adapter builds every
  ``--json`` envelope from the typed results' fields.

* **Mind-map detection is kind-aware and uses two different RPC families.** The
  ``rename`` path consults ``client.mind_maps.list`` (typed :class:`MindMap`
  objects carrying ``kind``) so it can route note-backed maps via ``UPDATE_NOTE``
  and interactive maps via ``RENAME_ARTIFACT`` behind the unified mind-map API
  (#1256). The ``delete`` path probes membership via the typed
  ``client.mind_maps.list_note_backed`` (one ``GET_NOTES_AND_MIND_MAPS``
  round-trip, the same single RPC the old raw-row scan issued, and the same
  mind-map-rows-only match) because note-backed maps are cleared via
  ``notes.delete``, not removed. Both call sets are preserved exactly so the
  recorded RPC cassettes stay stable.

* **The status DTO is neutral.** :class:`ArtifactStatusView` mirrors the public
  :class:`~notebooklm.types.GenerationStatus` fields the adapters read
  (``task_id`` / ``status`` / ``url`` / ``error`` / ``error_code`` / ``metadata``
  / ``is_complete``) so the poll / wait / retry adapters never reach into the
  client dataclass directly; :func:`status_view` projects a ``GenerationStatus``
  (or any object exposing those attributes) into it.

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).
