"""Transport-neutral exception classification.

The CLI ``error_handler`` except-ladder and the MCP server's ``_CODE_TABLE``
both answer the same question — *which category of failure is this exception,
and is retrying worthwhile?* — and historically each kept its own copy of that
mapping. :func:`classify` is the single neutral source of truth for the
**category** decision; each adapter keeps its OWN code vocabulary and projects
the category onto it (CLI string codes + exit codes, MCP manifest-pinned codes).
See the rev-2 plan §5 ("split, not unified").

The category set is deliberately granular enough that the CLI's
``error_handler`` can recover every code it emits today 1:1:

==========================  ====================================
:class:`ErrorCategory`      CLI ``error_handler`` code
==========================  ====================================
``NOT_FOUND``               ``NOT_FOUND``
``AUTH``                    ``AUTH_ERROR``
``RATE_LIMITED``            ``RATE_LIMITED``
``VALIDATION``              ``VALIDATION_ERROR``
``CONFIG``                  ``CONFIG_ERROR``
``DEPENDENCY``              ``CONFIG_ERROR`` (missing optional extra; folds into CONFIG_ERROR)
``NETWORK``                 ``NETWORK_ERROR``
``NOTEBOOK_LIMIT``          ``NOTEBOOK_LIMIT``
``ARTIFACT_TIMEOUT``        ``ARTIFACT_TIMEOUT``
``TIMEOUT``                 (generic wait timeout — CLI maps to its own code)
``SERVER``                  (5xx — CLI currently folds into ``NOTEBOOKLM_ERROR``)
``RPC``                     (other RPC failures -> ``NOTEBOOKLM_ERROR``)
``SOURCE_MUTATION``         (``SourceMutationError`` carries its own ``.code``)
``SOURCE_ADD``              (``SourceAddError`` -> ``NOTEBOOKLM_ERROR``; non-fatal per-item)
``UNEXPECTED``              ``UNEXPECTED_ERROR`` (non-library exceptions)
==========================  ====================================

``SOURCE_MUTATION`` is the ``_app``-raised :class:`SourceMutationError`. It is
a deterministic CLI-input failure that carries its own ``.code`` vocabulary
(``AMBIGUOUS_ID`` / ``NOT_FOUND`` / ``CONFIRM_REQUIRED`` / …), so the CLI
projects that carried code rather than a category-derived one; the category
exists only so the coverage test never sees it fall through to ``LIBRARY``.

:func:`classify` is **class-sensitive**: it tests ``isinstance`` against the
``notebooklm.exceptions`` hierarchy most-specific-first, so an
:class:`ArtifactTimeoutError` classifies as ``ARTIFACT_TIMEOUT`` (not the
generic ``TIMEOUT``) and a :class:`NotebookLimitError` as ``NOTEBOOK_LIMIT``
(not the generic ``RPC``/library catch-all). Ordering matters because the
exceptions form a diamond (e.g. ``ArtifactTimeoutError`` is both a
``WaitTimeoutError`` and an ``ArtifactError``).

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).
