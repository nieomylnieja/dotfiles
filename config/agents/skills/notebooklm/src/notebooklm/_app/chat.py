"""Transport-neutral chat business logic.

This is the Click-free core of the ``ask`` / ``configure`` / ``history`` CLI
commands: it owns the conversation-id selection ladder, the ``configure``
mode/goal/length mapping + dispatch, the ``history`` fetch + note-content
formatting, and the ``ask`` save-as-note workflow. Every transport adapter (the
Click CLI today, the FastMCP server / future HTTP later) drives this core and
renders the typed result / status events into its own surface + exit-code
policy.

``_app`` returns **typed results only** — no ``--json`` envelope dicts. Each
adapter builds its own envelope from the typed fields (e.g. the CLI's
``history``/``configure``/``history --clear`` ``--json`` payloads). The
``format_*`` helpers here produce *note content* (a saved-note markdown body, a
domain artifact), not a presentation envelope, so they stay neutral.

Boundary-imposed seams worth calling out:

* **Status prose is emitted into an injected :class:`ProgressSink`, never
  printed.** The conversation-selection status lines (``"Continuing
  conversation ..."`` etc.) and the save-as-note status lines carry Rich markup
  but are emitted as :class:`ProgressEvent` messages so the CLI adapter routes
  them through its markup-aware ``cli_print`` / ``emit_status`` (honoring root
  ``--quiet`` / JSON-stdout purity). This module never touches a console.

* **The cached-context reads are injected.** :func:`determine_conversation_id`
  takes the cached notebook/conversation values as plain arguments so the CLI
  adapter supplies them from its ``get_current_notebook`` /
  ``get_current_conversation`` context helpers (preserving the
  ``patch("...chat_cmd.get_current_*")`` test seams in the adapter layer).

Conversation IDs pass straight through (no validation / resolution here) — the
server owns their shape and a partial/explicit id is forwarded verbatim to
``ChatAPI.ask``.

This module depends only on the public ``notebooklm`` surface — no ``click`` /
``rich`` / ``cli`` / ``fastmcp`` and no runtime-internal (``notebooklm.rpc`` /
``notebooklm._*``) imports (enforced by
``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``). The chat RPC enums ``ChatGoal`` /
``ChatResponseLength`` are consumed through their ``notebooklm.types``
re-export, not by reaching into ``notebooklm.rpc.types``.

    a non-empty ``persona`` selects the ``CUSTOM`` goal. The ``goal_name`` is the
    lowercase enum name (e.g. ``"custom"``) for a stable, human-readable JSON
    contract.

    ``client.chat.configure`` writes the WHOLE chat-settings block with no
    server-side merge, so a *partial* custom update (exactly one of ``persona`` /
    ``response_length``) would clobber the omitted field (#1751). To prevent that,
    a partial update first reads ``client.chat.get_settings`` and preserves the
    unspecified field (read-modify-write). Two paths deliberately skip the read:
    a **bare** call (neither field) keeps the documented reset-to-defaults
    affordance, and a call supplying **both** fields already has a complete block.
    The result still reports only what THIS call changed (the delta), so a merge
    does not widen the JSON contract.

    The partial merge costs one extra ``GET_NOTEBOOK`` round-trip and is
    read-modify-write, so it is **not atomic**: a concurrent writer between the
    read and the write is last-writer-wins (there is no server-side compare-and-set).
    That matches the notebook's existing single-tenant, low-concurrency usage.

    A ``chat_mode`` preset replaces the whole chat-settings block (it
    short-circuits to ``set_mode``), so it cannot be combined with a custom
    ``persona`` / ``response_length`` — that combination is rejected here rather
    than silently dropping the custom fields. An empty ``persona`` ("") is a no-op
    (only a truthy persona selects CUSTOM) and so does not block a preset; any
    explicit ``response_length`` (incl. ``"default"``) is a real setting and does.
