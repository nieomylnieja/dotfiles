"""Transport-neutral notebook business logic.

This is the Click-free core of ``cli/notebook_cmd.py``: it owns the
``create`` / ``delete`` / ``rename`` / ``describe`` (summary) / ``metadata``
workflows and returns typed result dataclasses instead of an adapter-shaped
envelope dict. Every transport adapter (the Click CLI today, the FastMCP
server / future HTTP later) drives this core and renders the typed result into
its own surface + exit-code policy.

Two boundary-imposed seams are worth calling out:

* **The partial-notebook-id resolver is injected, never imported.**
  ``cli.resolve.resolve_notebook_id`` reaches into ``rich`` consoles for its
  "Matched: ..." diagnostic, so this module cannot import it without breaking
  the ``_app`` boundary. Instead the executors take a ``resolve_notebook_id``
  callable (the CLI wrapper passes its own). Reading the resolver off the
  wrapper at call time also preserves the historical ``monkeypatch`` seam.
* **The summary/metadata *serializers* stay in the CLI.** This core only
  fetches/computes the typed ``NotebookDescription`` / ``NotebookMetadata``
  payloads; the text rendering + ``--json`` envelope build live in the command
  layer (the survey: "the serializer STAYS in CLI; the fetch/compute moves").

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).

    backfill just those two keys, skipping it when both are already present (no
    wasted RPC) or the id is empty (no ``get("")``).

    The fill is PER-KEY and strictly additive: a slot is filled only when the
    create left it ``None`` AND the re-read has a value, so a populated create
    timestamp is never touched and a lagging re-read that returns ``None``
    cannot REGRESS a populated slot back to ``None``. The create already
