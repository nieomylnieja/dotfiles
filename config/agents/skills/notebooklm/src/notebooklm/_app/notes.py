"""Transport-neutral note business logic.

This is the Click-free core of ``cli/note_cmd.py``: it owns the
``create`` / ``get`` / ``save`` / ``rename`` / ``delete`` workflows and the
get-then-update "preserve content" rename path (``resolve_note_content``). It
consumes only the **typed** facade (``notes.create`` returns a
:class:`~notebooklm.types.Note`; failures raise) — no raw RPC payloads cross
into this layer — and returns typed result dataclasses instead of an
adapter-shaped envelope dict.
Every transport adapter (the Click CLI today, the FastMCP server / future HTTP
later) drives this core and renders the typed result into its own surface +
exit-code policy.

Two boundary-imposed seams are worth calling out:

* **The partial-id resolvers are injected, never imported.**
  ``cli.resolve.resolve_notebook_id`` / ``resolve_note_id`` reach into ``rich``
  consoles for their "Matched: ..." diagnostics, so this module cannot import
  them without breaking the ``_app`` boundary. The executors take
  ``resolve_notebook_id`` / ``resolve_note_id`` callables (the CLI wrapper
  passes its own, read at call time so the ``monkeypatch`` test seam lands).
* **The not-found typed error + exit policy stay in the CLI.** ``get`` / ``rename``
  return a result whose ``found`` flag is ``False`` when the row vanished
  between the partial-id resolve and the ``get``; the command layer maps that to
  its ``NOT_FOUND`` / exit-1 ``--json`` envelope (the BREAKING behaviour from
  issue #1247 / docs/cli-exit-codes.md). This core never raises for the
  concurrent-delete race — it reports it.

This module is transport-neutral — no ``click`` / ``rich`` / ``cli`` /
``fastmcp`` imports (enforced by ``tests/_guardrails/test_app_boundary.py``).
