"""Research row adapters for the ``POLL_RESEARCH`` (``e3bVqc``) payload.

These adapters centralise the positional knowledge that
``_research_task_parser.py`` previously open-coded as scattered single-level
subscripts (``result[0]``, ``src[1]``, ``bundle[0]``, ``task_info[1][0]`` …).
The parser wraps the raw lists in the typed views below and reads named
properties so a future Google reshape of the research wire format is a
one-place fix here, and so genuine drift on the *guaranteed* descents RAISES
``UnknownRPCMethodError`` via ``safe_index`` instead of silently degrading to
empty/wrong data (ADR-0011).

Two descent flavours are preserved exactly as the historical parser had them:

* **Guaranteed** slots — the two leading slots of a task row (``task_data[0]``
  task id, ``task_data[1]`` task info) — descend through ``safe_index`` so an
  absent slot RAISES (that is genuine shape drift; the task cannot be parsed
  without them).
* **Routinely-optional** slots — every research-source field and the
  query / sources / summary bundle reads — are length-guarded *inside* the
  adapter and short-circuit to a default, matching the parser's permissive
  contract (a deep-research source legitimately omits its URL, a fast-research
  task legitimately omits its summary, …).

Position contracts (pinned by ``tests/unit/test_research_row_adapter.py``):

* :class:`ResearchTaskRow` — one task row (``tasks[i]``):

  =====  ============================================================
  Index  Meaning
  =====  ============================================================
  0      task id (str) — GUARANTEED (``safe_index``)
  1      task info block (list) — GUARANTEED (``safe_index``)
  2      update time — ``[seconds, nanos]``
  3      create time — ``[seconds, nanos]``
  4      account id (str)
  =====  ============================================================

* :class:`ResearchTaskInfoRow` — one task info block (``task_data[1]``):

  =====  ============================================================
  Index  Meaning
  =====  ============================================================
  1      query block; ``[1][0]`` is the original query text
  2      ``DiscoveryMode`` code (int)
  3      sources/summary bundle; ``[3][0]`` sources list, ``[3][1]`` summary
  4      status code (int)
  =====  ============================================================

* :class:`ResearchResultRow` — one source row (``sources_data[i]``):

  =====  ============================================================
  Index  Meaning
  =====  ============================================================
  0      URL (str) for fast research; ``None`` sentinel for deep research
  1      title (str) — or, for the compat shape, ``[title, report]``
  2      hint (str) — the backend's one-line "why this source" note
  3      authoritative result-type tag
  6      typed content block; kind 3 carries report markdown at position 0
  8      deep-research per-task source ordinal (int)
