"""Free-function event-loop affinity guard.

A single small helper that compares a previously-captured event loop reference
against ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` and raises an actionable
:class:`RuntimeError` on mismatch. Lives in its own module so the helpers
that need to call it (``_transport_drain.py`` / ``_reqid_counter.py`` /
``_runtime/auth.py`` / ``_artifact/polling.py`` / ``_chat/api.py``) can import it
without dragging in the deleted concrete session type just to reach a
bound-loop attribute.

Design constraints:

* Module-private helper, intentionally tiny. The body is a single
  ``is``-comparison so the per-call cost on the hot path (e.g.
  :meth:`ReqidCounter.next_reqid` is called once per chat ask) stays
  negligible.

* ``bound_loop is None`` is a silent no-op so callers that haven't yet
  observed an ``open()`` (most notably standalone fixtures that construct
  the helpers directly without a :class:`NotebookLMClient`) keep working without
  a special-case branch on every call site.

* The error message is intentionally stable so downstream call sites can
  surface a uniform diagnostic regardless of which seam catches the
  cross-loop call first.

Test coverage lives in ``tests/unit/concurrency/test_loop_affinity_guard.py``.

    """Raise ``RuntimeError`` if the current running loop is not ``bound_loop``.

    Args:
        bound_loop: The loop the owning client / helper captured at
            ``open()`` time, or ``None`` if no binding has happened yet.
            ``None`` is a silent no-op — callers reach the helper before a
            binding exists (standalone fixtures, lazy-init paths) and the
            guard's job is to catch *cross-loop* misuse, not to enforce
            that a binding is present.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: When ``bound_loop`` is non-``None`` and differs from
            ``asyncio.get_running_loop()``. The message is shared across
            call sites so callers see a consistent diagnostic regardless of
            which entry point caught the mismatch.
