"""Request-shape types for the shared authed POST pipeline.

This module gathers the shared request-construction types used by the
middleware chain. It owns the request Interface that RPC, chat, auth refresh,
and the chain terminal share.

Five names live here:

- :data:`AuthSnapshot` — point-in-time view of auth headers used to build
  one HTTP attempt. ADR-0009 pins this as the public input type of the
  ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` callbacks.
- :data:`BuildRequest` — sync callable that maps an ``AuthSnapshot`` to a
  ``(url, body, headers)`` tuple ready for the transport. The chain leaf reads
  the materialized ``RpcRequest`` fields directly; the callable remains in
  ``RpcRequest.context["build_request"]`` so auth refresh and terminal
  freshness checks can rebuild the envelope from a new snapshot.
- :data:`PostBody` — body type accepted by the legacy tuple-return
  ``BuildRequest`` shape and by the low-level streaming POST helper.
- :class:`BuildRequestResult` — the *named* dataclass form of the same
  ``(url, body, headers)`` triple, used by the
  ``AuthRefreshMiddleware.build_request_factory`` callback. The dataclass
  shape is preferred for new code (named fields, immutable, type-checked
  at construction) over the legacy tuple return. Existing callers continue
  to use the tuple shape until they migrate.
- :func:`materialize_build_request` — bridge from the legacy tuple callback
  to ``BuildRequestResult``. This is the contract used before handing a request
  envelope to ``Kernel.post``.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the full chain contract.

    instead of the legacy ``(url, body, headers)`` tuple so the constructor
    signature reads as a single named value rather than positional unpacking.

    The fields mirror the tuple's positional order:

    - ``url`` — fully-built ``batchexecute`` URL (including ``authuser`` and
      ``_reqid`` query params).
    - ``body`` — encoded ``batchexecute`` body. Pinned to :class:`bytes` in
      ADR-0009; the legacy ``BuildRequest`` tuple accepts ``str | bytes`` for
      backward compatibility with existing call sites that build the body as
      a UTF-8 string.
    - ``headers`` — extra headers to merge for this request, or ``None`` when
      the snapshot's headers are sufficient.

    Frozen so a middleware cannot accidentally mutate a callback's return
    value before passing it back to the chain. Equality is value-based so
    tests can assert against expected results without identity tracking.
