"""CLI adapter for ``generate`` command orchestration — thin wrapper over ``_app``.

All Click-free generation business logic — the enum/format maps, plan
validation + coercion, the per-kind builders, the retry-with-backoff loop, the
wait orchestration, and the typed :class:`GenerationExecutionResult` /
:class:`GenerationOutcome` — now lives in the transport-neutral
:mod:`notebooklm._app.generate`. This module is the CLI-side adapter that:

* re-exports the typed plan/result/error names + ``build_generation_plan`` so
  existing ``notebooklm.cli.services.generate`` importers (the command layer in
  ``cli/generate_cmd.py`` and the direct-import tests in
  ``tests/unit/test_generate_service.py``) keep resolving unchanged, and
* injects the Click/``rich``-coupled :func:`resolve_notebook_id` /
  :func:`resolve_source_ids` resolvers into the neutral
  :func:`notebooklm._app.generate.execute_generation`.

The two resolvers are imported **inside** :func:`execute_generation` from
``cli.resolve`` and read at call time, so the historical
``monkeypatch.setattr(resolve_module, "resolve_notebook_id", ...)`` test seam
keeps landing. Command-layer rendering + exit codes live in
``cli/generate_cmd.py`` per ADR-0008.
