"""Playwright-driven Google login service (ADR-0008 click-to-service extraction).

Owns the interactive ``notebooklm login`` Playwright fast path (the rookiepy
``--browser-cookies`` path stays in :mod:`notebooklm.cli.services.login`). The
Click handler stays a thin orchestrator over this service.

This module is the **CLI adapter** over the transport-neutral browser-capture
core in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.browser_capture` (ADR-0021): the neutral
launch -> navigate -> capture -> filter -> persist sequence lives in the
``_auth`` core, reachable by the client runtime and by the headless re-auth
layer; the interactive / presentation concerns — the chromium install
pre-flight, flag-conflict validation, path preparation, account-metadata
repair, and the human-readable error hints — stay here. The neutral helpers and
constants the core owns (``run_browser_capture``,
``filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy``, ``recover_page``,
``windows_playwright_event_loop``, the retry constants, ``BROWSER_CLOSED_HELP``,
…) are re-exported below so existing import paths and test patch seams keep
resolving.

Presentation / exit / async-runner side effects are inverted behind the
:class:`LoginIO` Protocol: callers inject a concrete sink (the command-layer
:mod:`notebooklm.cli.playwright_login_io`) so this module imports no
``..rendering`` / ``..error_handler`` / ``..runtime`` command modules (#1391,
ADR-0008 level-2-import boundary). Pre-flight helpers return typed outcomes
(:class:`Conflict`, :class:`PreparedPaths`, :class:`PathError`); the command
wrappers render + exit. Entry points: :class:`PlaywrightLoginPlan`,
:func:`run_playwright_login`, :func:`prepare_login_paths`,
:func:`validate_login_flag_conflicts`,
:func:`filter_storage_state_cookies_by_domain_policy`.
