"""Cookie-domain allowlist + ``--include-domains`` policy helpers.

Leaf module within the ``cli/services/login/`` package (no in-package
imports). Owns:

- :data:`_INCLUDE_DOMAINS_ALL` — sentinel label for "include every optional
  sibling-product domain".
- :func:`_parse_include_domains` — pure label parser.
- :func:`_warn_missing_optional_domains` — migration-warning message builder.
- :func:`_resolve_optional_cookie_domains` — label → domain-set resolver.
- :func:`_build_google_cookie_domains` — final domain list builder.
