"""Single source of truth for resolving the active CLI auth source.

Historically, the question "where does authentication come from for this
command?" was answered by three independent reimplementations that all had
slightly different shapes:

* ``cli/context.py:_current_storage_override`` — reads ``ctx.obj["storage_path"]``
  (set by the root ``--storage`` Click option) and canonicalizes it.
* ``cli/helpers.py:_current_storage_override`` — a thin forwarding wrapper
  kept for backward compatibility with historical patch sites.
* ``cli/auth_runtime.py:_resolve_auth_storage_path`` — picks between the
  explicit ``storage_path`` and the ``NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`` env-var
  fast-path before falling back to ``get_storage_path(profile=...)``.

The duplication was load-bearing: adding a new precedence rule (e.g.
"profile env var beats stored cookies") meant chasing the change through
all three call sites. `AuthSource` consolidates the precedence chain into
one immutable resolver so downstream readers ask one question:
"give me the resolved auth source for the current Click context."

Precedence (highest priority first):

1. **Explicit ``--storage <path>``** — wins everywhere. Treated as a
   complete override of the profile system: when set, the env-var fast
   path is skipped and the resolved path IS the storage file.
2. **``NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON`` env var** — inline JSON, no disk file.
   Returned as ``has_env_auth=True`` so callers can take the
   "no writable backing store" code path.
3. **Stored cookies under the active profile** — the default fallback.
   Resolved via ``paths.get_storage_path(profile=...)`` so each profile
   has its own ``storage_state.json``.

Single-import policy
====================

This module is the **only** site in ``src/notebooklm/cli/`` and
``src/notebooklm/notebooklm_cli.py`` that should read
``os.environ["NOTEBOOKLM_AUTH_JSON"]`` for precedence decisions. Other
callers route through :meth:`AuthSource.has_env_auth` or
:func:`auth_source_from_ctx`. Help strings and user-facing diagnostics
that mention the env var by name are fine — the policy targets *logic*
that branches on the env var, not text that names it.
