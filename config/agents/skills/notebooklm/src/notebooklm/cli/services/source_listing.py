"""CLI adapter for ``source list`` — fetch + prepare the source list payload.

The one piece of genuine business logic in this path — **which sources to
fetch** under an optional label filter — now lives in the transport-neutral
:func:`notebooklm._app.source_listing.fetch_sources`. This module is the
CLI-side adapter that owns the presentation half:

* builds the :class:`~notebooklm.cli.services.listing.ListSpec` (the JSON
  ``serialize`` shape, the Rich-table ``columns`` / ``row`` shape, and the
  ``envelope_extras``), and
* drives the shared :func:`~notebooklm.cli.services.listing.prepare_list`
  pipeline.

The neutral fetch core takes the label ``<id|name>`` resolver as an injected
callable; this adapter passes its own :func:`resolve_label_id` (read off this
module at call time, so a ``monkeypatch.setattr`` against it still lands).
Actual JSON / Rich rendering stays in the command layer.

    The Status column reports NotebookLM's *ingestion* pipeline, which stays
    ``ready`` after the underlying Drive file is deleted or unshared — so for
    those rows the bare label is actively misleading (#2111). Append the Drive
    verdict there rather than adding a Drive column: a column would be blank on
    every non-Drive row (the overwhelming majority) and would widen the table on
    **every** listing, whereas this costs nothing until a row is actually
    degraded. The trigger is the degraded verdict alone — a ``processing`` or
    ``error`` row whose Drive file is gone is annotated too, since the ingestion
    status is not what the Drive axis reports on.

    Be precise about "costs nothing", because Rich sizes columns table-wide:
    the *cell text* of healthy and non-Drive rows is unchanged, but when any row
    is annotated the wider Status column re-flows the whole table, so other
    rows' Title/ID can wrap or truncate. That re-flow is accepted only in the
    degraded case — a rare, actionable state where knowing the data is stale
    beats a roomier Title column. ``_build_spec`` pairs this with
    ``overflow="fold"`` on Status so the longest label
    (``gen_ai_access_denied``) wraps intact instead of ellipsizing away the very
    information the annotation exists to carry.

    The trigger is :attr:`~notebooklm.types.Source.is_drive_degraded`, so a code
    this client cannot map (``unknown``) is deliberately NOT flagged here: that
    predicate's contract is that an unnameable state is not evidence of
    degradation, and the table should not cry wolf across every row on protocol
    drift. ``source get`` and ``--json`` still report it — this is the triage
    column, not the full axis.

    ``--json`` is unaffected: it carries the full Drive axis on every row via
    :func:`~notebooklm.cli.services.source_serializers.source_row_payload`.
