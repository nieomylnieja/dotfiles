"""Research management CLI commands.

Commands:
    status      Check research status (single check)
    wait        Wait for research to complete (blocking)
    import      Import a completed run's sources (no wait for the run)
    cancel      Cancel an in-flight research run (fire-and-forget)

The ``wait`` command is a thin Click handler over
:func:`notebooklm.cli.services.research.execute_research_wait`, which
injects the CLI notebook resolver, source importer, and wait context into
the transport-neutral :mod:`notebooklm._app.research` core. Task-id
pinning is handled by ``ResearchAPI.wait_for_completion``. ``status`` and
``cancel`` are thin handlers over the same neutral core
(:func:`notebooklm._app.research.poll_and_classify` /
:func:`~notebooklm._app.research.cancel_research`). ``import`` is the
never-waits-for-the-run counterpart to ``wait --import-all`` (#2206): it drives the
same neutral pair the MCP ``research_import`` tool and the REST import
route drive (:func:`~notebooklm._app.research.classify_importable_research`
+ :func:`~notebooklm._app.research.import_research_sources`), so the
importable-state ladder and the idempotency contract cannot fork a third
time. This module owns input validation, spinner I/O, rendering, and exit
codes.
