"""Shared CLI option decorators.

Provides reusable option decorators to reduce boilerplate in commands.

Shell completion
-----------------------------

The ``-n/--notebook``, ``-s/--source``, and ``-a/--artifact`` options below
attach Click ``shell_complete`` callbacks that emit live IDs from the active
profile. Activate completion in your shell once (see ``docs/cli-reference.md``),
then ``notebooklm <cmd> -n <TAB>`` will list real notebook IDs.

The callbacks are intentionally **best-effort**: if auth is missing, the
network is offline, or any exception fires, they return ``[]`` so the user
just gets no suggestions instead of an error printed by their shell. This
keeps tab-completion safe to use even in fresh shells without credentials.

    Used by the generate/artifact/source polling commands so their flag surface
    stays uniform across ``generate <kind> --wait``, ``artifact wait``, and
    ``source wait``. ``research wait`` declares its own flags but mirrors the
    same positive-interval validation.
    Returns a decorator so each call site can supply its own historical
    defaults without diverging on flag name or help text.

    The ``--wait`` flag is intentionally NOT bundled here. It is a *trigger*
    flag on ``generate <kind>`` (paired with ``wait_option``) and is implicit
    on ``artifact wait`` / ``source wait`` (those subcommands ARE the wait).
    Bundling ``--wait`` here would either force-add it to commands that don't
    need it, or interact awkwardly with ``--wait/--no-wait``'s tri-state
    default on ``generate``. Keeping the trigger separate makes the surface
    uniform and honest about intent.

    Args:
        default_timeout: Default value for ``--timeout`` in seconds. Each
            command supplies its own wait budget (e.g. ``generate audio``
            uses 1200, ``source wait`` uses 120); this helper only
            standardizes the flag wiring and help text.
        default_interval: Default value for ``--interval`` in seconds. Most
            commands use 2 to match the existing ``artifact wait`` default;
            ``source wait`` uses 1 to match its underlying
            ``wait_until_ready`` default.
        timeout_help: Optional custom help text for commands whose effective
            timeout behavior depends on another option or alias.

    Returns:
        A decorator that adds ``--timeout`` and ``--interval`` Click options
        to the wrapped command. The wrapped function gains two kwargs:
