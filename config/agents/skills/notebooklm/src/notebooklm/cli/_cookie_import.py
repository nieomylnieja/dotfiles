"""Cookie-JSON import helpers for ``notebooklm auth import-cookies``.

Split out of :mod:`notebooklm.cli.session_cmd` to keep that module under the
ADR-0008 module-size budget (and to keep stdlib names like ``shutil`` off its
retired patch surface). ``register_session_commands`` imports
:func:`_import_cookie_json` / :func:`_read_auth_json_input` back.

These are presentation-adjacent CLI helpers (they raise ``click.ClickException``
directly), so they live beside the command rather than in ``cli/services/``.

    This is a deliberate copy, not an oversight. ``cli/`` may not import
