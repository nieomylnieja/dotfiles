#: leading dot and lowercased (the form :attr:`pathlib.PurePath.suffix` returns).
#:
#: The **input-side twin** of :data:`_SOURCE_TYPE_CODE_MAP`: that map says how the
#: backend labels a source on the way out, this set says how a user may spell one
#: on the way in. They are deliberately co-located so a newly supported file type
#: cannot gain a decode entry without a spelling — PowerPoint is the case that
#: proved the split (#2137/#2191 added ``6: SourceType.POWERPOINT`` while every
#: consumer of this set still had PowerPoint missing from its own copy, #2202).
#:
#: A *mapping* to :class:`SourceType` is deliberately NOT asserted here: only some
#: of these extensions have a live-captured decode code (pdf→3, md→8, docx→11,
#: pptx→6, csv→16, epub→17), and inventing codes for the rest (txt/rtf/odt/tsv)
#: would put unverified wire facts in a constant.

#: File-shaped extensions that are NOT asserted to be upload-accepted.
#:
#: The escape hatch that keeps :data:`_UPLOAD_FILE_EXTENSIONS` honest. The two
#: sets feed consumers with very different failure modes, so an extension has to
#: earn the first one:
#:
#: * the path heuristic only decides whether a *non-existent* argument gets a
#:   warning — a wrong entry costs nothing;
#: * the Drive router (``_source.drive_import``) uses the upload set as a
#:   **network** gate — a wrong entry turns a fast, clear client-side refusal
#:   into a full file download followed by a murky server-side failure.
#:
#: ``.ppt`` sits here because the evidence covers ``.pptx`` only: a real ``.pptx``
#: upload was live-probed to READY decoding as ``POWERPOINT`` (#2202), while
#: legacy ``.ppt`` — a different container (OLE compound file, not OOXML) — has
#: never been put on the wire. Renaming a ``.pptx`` to ``.ppt`` would prove
#: nothing. Move it up once a real legacy ``.ppt`` is probed; until then a
#: mistyped ``deck.ppt`` still earns its warning and the Drive router still
#: refuses it up front, which is the behavior with evidence behind it.
_FILE_SHAPED_ONLY_EXTENSIONS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({".ppt"})

#: HTML-family extensions NotebookLM's upload endpoint **rejects**. Tracked next to
#: the accepted set (rather than folded into it) because the two callers want them
#: on opposite sides: the upload/Drive gates reject them with convert-first
#: guidance, while the path heuristic must still recognise ``page.html`` as
#: file-shaped so a mistyped one is flagged rather than silently pasted in as
#: text content.
_HTML_FILE_EXTENSIONS: frozenset[str] = frozenset({".html", ".htm", ".xhtml", ".xht"})

#: Extensions that make an argument *look like a local file path*.
#:
#: Scope, precisely: ``source add``'s auto-detect checks ``Path(content).exists()``
#: BEFORE consulting this set, so an existing file is uploaded on its own merits
#: whatever its extension. This set decides what happens to a file-shaped argument
#: that does **not** exist — whether the user gets the "looks like a path but does
#: not exist" warning or has the string silently ingested as pasted text. A missing
#: extension therefore costs a typo'd filename its warning, which is exactly the
#: footgun the warning exists to catch (#2202).
#:
#: Derived — never hand-maintained — so a type gains its spelling here the moment
#: it becomes uploadable.

    Attributes:
        source_id: The source UUID.
        title: The source title.
        content: The legacy flat rendering — every text run the document tree
            contains, joined with ``"\\n"`` in traversal order. Kept
            byte-identical to its pre-#2128 output so existing callers are
            unaffected, which also means **its offsets are not the backend's**:
            the joins insert separators the wire's character ranges never
            accounted for. Use :attr:`document` when offsets matter, and
            :attr:`rendered_content` when readability does — joining *runs*
            rather than *blocks* splits paragraphs mid-sentence (#2211).
        url: The source URL, when it has one.
        char_count: ``len(content)`` — Python characters over the legacy flat
            rendering, **including the** ``"\\n"`` **separators that rendering
            inserts**. It is a size, not a coordinate: it is neither the
            document's extent nor comparable to any citation or annotation
            offset (those are UTF-16 code units over :attr:`document`, which
            has no separators). On the module's own test source the two read
            548 and 532. Use :attr:`document` for anything positional.
        document: The parsed document tree (#2128) — headings, list structure,
            per-run styling, and the character ranges everything indexes. This
            is the surface citation alignment is built on: resolve a
            ``ChatReference``'s ``start_char`` / ``end_char`` with
            ``document.slice(start_char, end_char)``. Empty (not ``None``) when
            the response carried no decodable document, so consumers never have
            to branch.

            Not emitted by the CLI ``--json`` / MCP / REST fulltext payloads,
            which stay pinned to their existing key sets.

    See also :attr:`rendered_content` — the readable rendering derived from
    :attr:`document`, and (like :attr:`document`) a Python-API surface only.

        :attr:`content` joins every text **run** with ``"\\n"``, and a run is a
        sub-paragraph fragment, so a paragraph the backend split into three runs
        becomes three lines. That is a consequence of flattening a tree nobody
        had parsed, not a rendering anybody chose. Since #2128 the tree *is*
        parsed, so this property renders from it instead — runs joined
        **within** a block, blocks separated, blocks with nothing to read
        omitted. A table is the one exception to "one line per block": it reads
        as one line per **row**, cells tab-separated, from the cell boundaries
        the parse carries alongside its flattened runs (#2230).
        :meth:`~notebooklm.types.StructuredDocument.render` carries the full
        account, including the measurement on this repo's own capture.

        It is derived, additive and free — the document is parsed on every
        ``get_fulltext`` regardless of ``output_format``, so nothing extra is
        fetched, and :attr:`content` is untouched for callers that depend on its
        exact bytes. Derived on *each* access rather than cached, so that it
        cannot go stale against a reassigned :attr:`document`; bind it to a
        local if you read it more than once.

        Like :attr:`content` and unlike
        :attr:`~notebooklm.types.StructuredDocument.text`, this rendering is
        **not** offset-addressable: the separators it inserts are its own.
        Resolve a citation's ``start_char`` / ``end_char`` with
        ``document.slice(...)``, or get a readable window around one from
        ``resolve_chat_reference_passage``.

        **With** ``output_format="markdown"`` **this is not "content, made
        readable".** That format fills :attr:`content` from the response's HTML
        rendition while :attr:`document` is parsed from its text blocks either
        way, so the two are then different renderings of different payload
        slots: markdown here, plain text there. Only in the default ``"text"``
        mode are they the same material laid out two ways.

        ``""`` when the response carried no decodable document (a source whose
        text arrived as bare strings), where :attr:`content` may still have
        text — this is a strictly structural rendering, never a fallback
        flattening. ``document.blocks`` tells the two apart: empty means
        nothing decoded, rather than a source with nothing in it.

        The search key is a prefix of ``cited_text``, capped at 40 characters
        **and at the first block boundary the citation crosses**. Both caps
        matter, and the second one is not an optimisation:

        :attr:`content` joins the document's text runs with ``"\n"`` —
        characters the backend never counted (#2128) — while ``cited_text``
        concatenates the cited blocks with no separator at all (#2120). A key
        that spans a block boundary therefore contains a join that ``content``
        renders differently, and **cannot match anywhere**. That is not
        hypothetical: a source whose first block is a short heading (14
        characters is typical) produces a 40-character key crossing the very
        first boundary, so every multi-block citation into it would fail to
        resolve.

        Before #2120 ``cited_text`` was truncated to the fragment's first block,
        so the key could not straddle a boundary and this never arose. Capping
        here restores that property for the *key* while leaving ``cited_text``
        the complete, offset-accurate value.

        This remains a value-based search against a string the citation offsets
        do not describe, and is now the **fallback** rather than the primary
        path: ``resolve_chat_reference_passage`` resolves by offset against
        :attr:`document` — exact, and needing no search — and only comes here
