        """Maintain the two derived-field invariants on every assignment.

        Two fields on this dataclass are derivations of another field, and both
        must stay *fields* rather than becoming properties: the MCP/REST
        serializer emits ``dataclasses.fields`` only, so a property would
        silently vanish from every adapter's response — a breaking wire change.
        The invariants are therefore maintained on assignment instead.

        1. ``is_owner`` mirrors ``role is SharePermission.OWNER`` (#2125).
        2. ``modified_at`` mirrors ``last_viewed_at`` (#2126). ``modified_at``
           is the deprecated alias — the wire slot is ``lastViewedTime``, never
           a modification time — kept through v1.0 so existing callers keep
           their keyword, their attribute reads, and their serialized JSON key.

        Hooking ``__setattr__`` rather than ``__post_init__`` matters because
        this dataclass is mutated in place after construction (see the timestamp
        backfill in ``_app.notebooks._backfill_create_timestamps``, which writes
        ``last_viewed_at``); a construction-only hook would let both derived
        fields go stale the moment anyone assigned the field they derive from.

        A contradictory ``is_owner`` is *corrected*, not rejected. Raising is not
        actually available here: ``is_owner`` has a plain ``True`` default, so
        the ordinary ``Notebook(id=..., title=..., role=VIEWER)`` call is
        indistinguishable from an explicit ``is_owner=True``, and rejecting the
        contradiction would reject the most natural construction in the codebase.

        When ``role`` is ``None`` (the row stated no level) the caller's
        ``is_owner`` is left untouched, preserving the historical
        optimistic-``True`` soft-degrade.

        The timestamp pair mirrors in *both* directions so a legacy caller who
        writes ``nb.modified_at = X`` after construction still round-trips —
        otherwise ``to_jsonable`` (which emits both fields) and the CLI's
        ``notebook_viewed_keys`` (which reads only the canonical one) would give
        two different answers for the same object.

        Both directions are guarded on ``value is not None``, and for a
        mechanical reason: the generated ``__init__`` assigns fields in
        declaration order, and ``modified_at`` comes first (it has to, so
        positional construction keeps working). An unguarded mirror would let
        ``__init__``'s later ``last_viewed_at=None`` default wipe out a legacy
        ``Notebook(..., modified_at=X)`` argument. Restoring the canonical field
        from that legacy argument is handled once in :meth:`__post_init__`.

        The residual gap is assigning ``None`` after construction
        (``nb.last_viewed_at = None`` leaves ``modified_at`` stale). Clearing a
        decoded timestamp is not something this codebase or any plausible caller
        does, and closing it would require an "``__init__`` finished" flag whose
        cost outlives the alias it protects.

        That does **not** raise ``AttributeError``, which is the tempting
        assumption — ``last_viewed_at`` is a dataclass field with a ``None``
