    """The backend's three-part identifier for one chat turn (#2122).

    Decoded from ``AnswerResponse.conversationTurnKey`` (proto tag 3 →
    ``answer_row[2]``), which the streamed-chat endpoint sends on **every**
    chunk of every answer. ``SubmitFeedbackRequest.conversationTurnKey``
    (tag 1) is the one consumer of this message in the recovered schema, so a
    caller wanting to build that call no longer has to re-plumb the stream
    parser to find the key.

    The three parts always travel together — a half-populated key addresses
    nothing — so they are modelled as one value object rather than three loose
    optionals on :class:`AskResult`, and :attr:`session_id` is required.

    .. warning::
       :attr:`session_id` is **not** a conversation id, despite carrying one in
       some captures. It is the same wire slot
       ``AnswerRow.server_conversation_id`` reads, which issue #659 established
       is a per-stream identifier: querying ``khqZz`` with it returns 0 turns,
       and passing it back as a follow-up ``conversation_id`` produces a ghost
       turn the server does not record.

       The evidence is genuinely mixed, so this class does not pick a side. In
       a live two-turn probe (2026-08-13) it held the value ``hPTbtc`` returned,
       identical on both turns of one conversation. In this repo's own recorded
       cassettes it differs from the recorded ``hPTbtc`` id in 4/4 chat
       captures. Because it cannot be relied on to be a conversation id, it is
       exposed under its **proto** name and nothing is claimed for it. Use
       :attr:`AskResult.conversation_id` for follow-ups.

    Attributes:
        session_id: Wire slot 0 (proto ``sessionId``). Required — the key is
            addressed by it. Plausibly the ``chatSessionId`` that
            ``GenerateFreeFormStreamedRequest`` (tag 5) and
            ``DeleteChatTurnsRequest`` (tag 2) carry, though nothing here
            confirms that. See the warning above before treating it as a
            conversation id.
        turn_id: Wire slot 1 (proto ``conversationId``). Held a *different*
            UUID on each turn of one conversation in every observation, so it
            identifies the turn rather than the conversation — which is why it
            is NOT named for its proto field.
        turn_code: Wire slot 2 (proto ``fieldType``). An integer, constant
            across every chunk of one turn and different on the next. The
            proto's ``fieldType`` label is the schema extractor's placeholder
            for a name it could not recover, and the observed values are not
            type tags, so this is carried verbatim and NOT interpreted.

    """A reference/citation in a chat response.

    References link parts of the answer to specific sources.
    When you click a reference in the NotebookLM UI, it shows
    the relevant passage from the source.

    Attributes:
        source_id: The source UUID this reference points to.
        citation_number: The citation number shown in the answer (e.g., [1], [2]).
            Assigned client-side in answer-array order; this is the marker that
            appears inline in the answer text.
        cited_text: The cited source passage, verbatim — every block of the
            fragment concatenated, with no separators, no stripping and no
            filler. Before #2120 it was truncated to the fragment's first
            block: 37 of 556 characters in the live capture that motivated the
            fix. ``None`` for a structural-anchor citation that decoded no
            blocks at all.

            **Do not derive offsets from its length.** ``len(cited_text)`` is
            *usually* ``end_char - start_char`` and is not guaranteed to be:
            it counts Python characters while the range counts UTF-16 code
            units (so an emoji costs one), and the fragment may span positions
            this client does not render as text (an image, a rule, and for now
            a code block — see ``BlockKind``), which are omitted here rather
            than filled. If you need the span's width, take it from the range
            itself (``end_char - start_char``) rather than from any string —
            ``SourceFulltext.document.slice(start_char, end_char)`` returns
            exactly that range but counts Python characters too, so it is
            ``utf16_len()`` of the slice, not ``len()``, that equals the range.
            This field is the reading optimised for being read.
        start_char: Start of the cited fragment in the **source document's**
            coordinate space — the lowest ``start_index`` among its blocks,
            counted in **UTF-16 code units** (see ``utf16_len``). Resolve it
            with ``SourceFulltext.document.slice(start_char, end_char)``.

            It is **not** interchangeable with the ``offset`` parameter of
            ``source read`` / ``sources.read()``, in two independent ways:
            that offset windows ``SourceFulltext.content``, a different string
            (the legacy flat rendering, whose ``"\n"`` joins the backend never
            counted), and it counts Python characters rather than UTF-16 units.
            Passing one where the other is expected yields a window that looks
            plausible and is wrong. See
            `#2211 <https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2211>`_.
        end_char: End of that range (exclusive) — the highest ``end_index``
            among the fragment's blocks.
        chunk_id: The citation's ``DocumentObject.objectId``. Also the key the
            answer document's annotation map anchors on, which is what joins
            this reference to ``answer_anchor_start`` / ``answer_anchor_end``
            (#2120). Not user-facing.
        passage_id: Forward-compatibility slot for the per-passage UUID
            that NotebookLM's web UI sends in its saved-from-chat
            CREATE_NOTE payload (issue #660). The streaming chat response
            does NOT currently expose this UUID, so it stays ``None`` in
            production. ``build_save_chat_as_note_params`` falls back to
            ``chunk_id`` when it's unset.
        answer_start_char: **Deprecated alias for** ``fragment_start_char``
            (#2120) — despite the name it was never an answer-text position.
        answer_end_char: **Deprecated alias for** ``fragment_end_char``.
        score: Server-side relevance score for this citation, 0.0-1.0.
            Typically observed in the 0.6-0.7 range. ``None`` if the server
            omitted it.
        fragment_start_char: Start of the cited fragment's **source-side**
            character range, as declared by the server. Same coordinate space
            as ``start_char`` / ``end_char``, which this client derives
            independently from the fragment's blocks; the two have agreed on
            every capture so far, and a disagreement means the server and this
            client no longer read the fragment the same way. ``None`` if the
            server omitted it.

            (The slot is ``Citation``'s protobuf tag 4, which the recovered
            schema in ``docs/mobile/schema.proto`` does not name — the meaning
            is established by live capture, not by that file.)
        fragment_end_char: End of that source-side range (exclusive).
        answer_anchor_start: Start of the range **of the answer** this
            citation supports, read from the answer document's annotation map
            (#2120). Resolve it with
            ``AskResult.answer_document.slice(answer_anchor_start,
            answer_anchor_end)`` — the offsets index that document, *not*
            ``AskResult.answer``, which additionally carries markdown emphasis
            and the inline ``[N]`` markers the document does not. ``None`` when
            the answer carried no annotation for this citation.

            Named ``anchor`` rather than ``range`` because it frequently has
            zero width: the backend commonly anchors a citation at the
            insertion point of its ``[N]`` marker rather than over a span. The
            name is also deliberately unlike the deprecated
            ``answer_start_char`` — which, despite the shared prefix, holds a
            *source*-side value and is not this field's predecessor.
        answer_anchor_end: End of that anchor (exclusive), equal to
            ``answer_anchor_start`` for a zero-width anchor.

        ``answer_start_char`` / ``answer_end_char`` are the pre-#2120 names for
        ``fragment_start_char`` / ``fragment_end_char``. They must stay
        *fields* rather than become properties: the MCP/REST serializer emits
        ``dataclasses.fields`` only, so a property would silently vanish from
        every adapter's response. The invariant is therefore maintained on
        assignment, mirroring ``Notebook.__setattr__`` (#2126).

        Both directions mirror, so a legacy caller that writes
        ``ref.answer_start_char = X`` after construction still round-trips.
        Each is guarded on ``value is not None`` for a mechanical reason: the
        generated ``__init__`` assigns in declaration order and the deprecated
        names come first, so an unguarded mirror would let the canonical
        field's later ``None`` default wipe out a legacy
        ``ChatReference(..., answer_start_char=X)`` argument.
        :meth:`__post_init__` restores the canonical field from that legacy
        argument once, at birth.

        leaves ``answer_start_char`` stale, and
        ``dataclasses.replace(ref, answer_start_char=X)`` is a no-op on a ref

        the parser or any plausible caller does — the parser builds these once

            ``SubmitFeedback`` is addressed by. ``None`` when the stream
            carried no usable key, which includes every ``AskResult`` built by
            hand or by an older code path, so callers must treat it as
            optional. ``turn_key.session_id`` is a raw wire value and is **not**
            a substitute for :attr:`conversation_id`; see
            :class:`ConversationTurnKey`.
        next_steps: Suggested follow-up questions/actions volunteered with the
            winning answer row. Empty when the stream omitted the optional
            ``NextStepSuggestions`` block.
