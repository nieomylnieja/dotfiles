    surfaced ``DecodingError`` / ``UnknownRPCMethodError`` raised while decoding
    the response envelope (``safe_index`` inside the decoder). Wire-schema drift
    is the stated #1 breakage class, so this counter separates "Google reshaped
    a response" from an ordinary 5xx / network failure (which lands in
    ``rpc_calls_failed`` via the transport-leg ``MetricsMiddleware``). A decode
    error recovered by a refresh-and-retry is NOT counted; only the error that
    ultimately surfaces is.

    Scope note: this covers drift detected at the executor boundary. Positional
    drift raised *later* by feature-layer ``safe_index`` navigation (after
    ``rpc_call`` returns — e.g. ``_extract_summary``) propagates straight to the
