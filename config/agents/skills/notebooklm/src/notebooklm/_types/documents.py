"""Structured-document types shared by the source-content and chat-answer paths.

NotebookLM returns prose as a ``TailwindDoc`` — a nested positional tree whose
shape is recovered in ``docs/mobile/schema.proto`` (section
``orchestration.v1/tailwind_doc.pb.dart``). Three call sites carry the *same*
tree:

* ``GET_SOURCE`` (fulltext) — ``result[3][0]`` is the source's document ``Body``.
* ``GenerateFreeFormStreamed`` — ``responseDoc.body`` is the answer's ``Body``.
* Each streamed-chat citation — ``Citation.fragment.elements`` is a bare list of
  the same ``StructuralElement`` blocks, sliced out of the source document.

Before #2128 / #2120 the client flattened all three to a bag of strings, which
threw away the one thing citations need: the **character offsets**. Every block
and span carries ``start_index`` / ``end_index`` into a single document-wide
coordinate space, and :attr:`StructuredDocument.text` is laid out at those
offsets — so :meth:`StructuredDocument.slice` is by construction what the
backend meant by ``[n, m)``. :class:`DocumentAnnotation` then anchors a document
object (a citation) to a range in that space.

Those offsets are **UTF-16 code units**, not Python characters
(:func:`utf16_len`). The distinction is invisible until a document contains an
emoji and then costs one position per astral character, which is why
:meth:`StructuredDocument.slice` exists rather than callers indexing
:attr:`StructuredDocument.text` directly.

They are also not the only offset space this library exposes: ``source read``'s
``offset`` parameter windows :attr:`~notebooklm.types.SourceFulltext.content`
in Python characters. The two are not interchangeable — different string,
different unit — and mixing them produces a plausible-looking wrong answer
rather than an error. See `#2211
<https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2211>`_.

Which leaves three renderings of the same source, each answering a different
question: :attr:`~notebooklm.types.SourceFulltext.content` is what this client
has always returned and stays byte-identical; :attr:`StructuredDocument.text`
is where offsets resolve; and :meth:`StructuredDocument.render` — surfaced as
:attr:`~notebooklm.types.SourceFulltext.rendered_content` — is the one meant to
be read. :meth:`StructuredDocument.render` documents what separates them.

The types here are transport-neutral and carry no positional knowledge; the
``TailwindDoc`` array positions live in
:mod:`notebooklm._row_adapters.documents`.

           reversed must still read forwards.
        2. **They lie inside it.** A span is a *part of* a block, so one
           claiming a range beyond its parent is drift. Left alone, that drift
           travels: it displaces the layout cursor across the *next* block,
           whose spans are then dropped as already-covered, and a valid block
           reads back as a malformed neighbour's suffix. Clamping confines the
           damage to the block that carries it.
        3. **They are frozen for real.** ``frozen=True`` stops *rebinding* the
           attribute; it does not copy what was bound, so a caller passing a
           list keeps a live handle able to change this block's ``text`` and
           every ``slice`` taken from the enclosing document afterwards.

        Establishing all three *here* rather than in the layout is what makes
        them hold at every nesting level: table cells hold blocks
        too, and are flattened into their table's spans, so a rule enforced
        only at the top level would not reach them. It also means
        :attr:`text` — and through it ``ChatReference.cited_text``, which never
        goes near the layout — inherits the same guarantees.

        The third of this library's three renderings of a source, and the only
        one built for *reading*:

        * :attr:`notebooklm.types.SourceFulltext.content` is the legacy flat
          rendering, frozen byte-for-byte. It joins every text **run** with
          ``"\\n"`` — and a run is a sub-paragraph fragment, so a paragraph the
          backend split into three runs becomes three lines. On the captured
          source in ``tests/unit/fixtures/source_fulltext_tailwind_doc.json``
          that turns 13 blocks into 17 lines, one of them a lone ``" "``.
        * :attr:`text` is the offset-faithful layout. It inserts no separators
          at all (that is what makes :meth:`slice` exact) and fills undecodable
          positions with ``"\\ufffc"``, so blocks run together and filler shows.
        * This method joins runs **within** a block and separates **blocks**,
          which is what the flat rendering was reaching for and could not do
          before the tree was parsed (#2128). It is not offset-addressable —
          the separators it inserts are its own — so anything positional still
          belongs on :meth:`slice`.

        A block that contributes no text is omitted rather than rendered as a
        blank line: an image or a horizontal rule has nothing to read, and
        empty strings are dropped by the legacy rendering too.

        Runs that overlap *inside* a block are trimmed against what the block
        has already rendered, so no line is wider than the window that selected
        it. Whole *blocks* that overlap each other each render in full, which
        is the one place this rendering deliberately differs from :attr:`text`:
        the layout de-duplicates because it must keep later offsets true, and
        this has no offsets to keep — dropping one of two blocks that both
        claim a range would hide text that decoded.

        The rendering is deliberately **marker-free**: a list item renders as
        its text, without ``list_info.glyph``, and a heading without any ``#``.
        This is the flat rendering ``content`` should always have been, not a
        markdown one; a decorated rendering is a future keyword argument rather
        than a change of what this returns. Read :attr:`blocks` when you want
        the structure.

        A :attr:`BlockKind.TABLE` renders as **one line per row, with its cells
        separated by a tab** — the one block kind that is not one line. Its
        runs are flattened into a single span sequence by the parse (#2128) and
        a cell is several of them, so nothing at this level could tell a cell
        boundary from a formatting change; the boundaries are read from
        :attr:`DocumentBlock.table_rows`, which the parse now carries as
        offsets alongside the flattened runs
        (`#2230 <https://github.com/teng-lin/notebooklm-py/issues/2230>`_).
        They are offsets only, so nothing about the coordinate space moves:
        :attr:`DocumentBlock.text` and ``ChatReference.cited_text`` still read
        a table's cells run together, and the separators here — like the
        newline between blocks — exist in this rendering alone.

        Args:
            start_index: Inclusive start of the range to render, in **UTF-16
                code units** (see :func:`utf16_len`), clamped up to ``0``.
            end_index: Exclusive end of the range, clamped down to
                :attr:`extent`.

        Returns:
            The rendered text, or ``""`` for an empty document or a range that
            selects nothing. A partially selected block renders only the part
            inside the range, so a window around a citation reads as a window
            rather than as whole surrounding blocks, and the result never
            carries more text than the range selects.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If exactly one bound is ``None``. Passing **neither**
                renders the whole document; passing **both** renders that
                range. A half-specified range is refused rather than guessed
                because the obvious guess is the dangerous one: :meth:`slice`
                takes the same optional pair and returns ``""`` when either is
                absent (a citation the answer did not annotate), so silently
                reading a missing bound as "unbounded" here would turn a
                substituted ``slice`` call into the whole document — a
                plausible-looking wrong answer, which is the failure mode this
