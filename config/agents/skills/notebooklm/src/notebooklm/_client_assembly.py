"""Single client-assembly seam shared by production and the test factory.

:func:`_assemble_client` is the ONE place that wires a
:class:`~notebooklm.client.NotebookLMClient` instance: auth normalization,
seam resolution, collaborator composition (via
:func:`notebooklm._runtime.init.compose_client_internals`), the upload
pipeline, and every feature API. Two callers exist:

1. ``NotebookLMClient.__init__`` (production) — delegates its whole body
   here, passing only its public kwargs.
2. ``tests/_helpers/client_factory.build_client_shell_for_tests`` — calls
   ``NotebookLMClient.__new__`` and then this function with the
   test-only injection seams (``decode_response`` / ``sleep`` /
   ``is_auth_error`` / ``async_client_factory`` plus ``refresh_callback`` /
   ``refresh_retry_delay`` / ``connect_timeout`` /
   ``keepalive_storage_path``).

History: the test factory previously duplicated this wiring by hand
against ``NotebookLMClient.__new__``. That drifted twice — issue #1196
(the open-time upload-semaphore loop reset needed ``_source_uploader``)
and issue #1225 (the open-time ChatAPI conversation-lock reset needed
``chat``) — each time silently stranding the shell until a test happened
to exercise the missing attribute. Sharing one assembly function makes
that whole drift class structurally impossible;
``tests/_guardrails/test_client_factory_parity.py`` pins the remaining
edges (attributes added *outside* this function).

This module is private: it is not exported from ``notebooklm`` and the
test-only parameters MUST NOT be promoted to ``NotebookLMClient``'s
public constructor (see the seam policy in ``_client_seams``).
