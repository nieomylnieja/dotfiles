    Batch scaling (#2187): the server ingests every entry (fetch/parse/embed)
    before responding to one RPC, so a large deep-research batch needs
    materially more time than a 3-source fast-research one. The base term is a
    floor so a tiny import still fails fast on a genuinely broken call; the max
    is a ceiling so a pathologically large batch is still bounded rather than
    open-ended.

    Composition (#2205): the scaled window is a *default*, so it is floored at
    the client's configured ``base_timeout`` — a caller who bought
    ``timeout=600`` keeps 600 s here instead of being silently capped at 240 s.

    ``override`` is the ``import_research_timeout`` constructor kwarg and reads
    exactly like ``chat_timeout`` does, so the two knobs are one rule:

    * :data:`AUTO_READ_TIMEOUT` (unset) — batch-scaled, floored at ``base_timeout``;
    * a number — the caller's word, replacing both the scaling and the floor;
    * ``None`` — inherit ``base_timeout`` verbatim (no per-RPC override).

    Retry-budget clamp (#2205): ``remaining_budget`` is what is left of
    ``import_sources_with_verification``'s ``max_elapsed`` when this attempt
    starts, so a late retry cannot be *granted* a window larger than the budget
    it has left — without it, a retry starting 50 s from the deadline still got
    the full batch-scaled (or configured) window. It is applied last, so it
    also bounds an ``override`` and an inherited (``None``) window. That caller
    only passes a budget it has already found viable — see
    ``MIN_IMPORT_RESEARCH_ATTEMPT_TIMEOUT``, which is what keeps this from
    producing a uselessly small window.

    What this is *not*: a wall-clock deadline for the attempt. Every timeout in
    this client is an ``httpx`` slot, and ``read`` is an inactivity limit
    between socket reads — connect/pool waits sit outside it, and a server that
    keeps dribbling bytes just inside the window keeps the request alive. So
    the clamp bounds what an attempt is *given*, not how long it can take.
    Enforcing the latter would mean cancelling an in-flight
    ``NON_IDEMPOTENT_NO_RETRY`` POST, trading a bounded overshoot for an
    unbounded duplicate-source risk (#808).
