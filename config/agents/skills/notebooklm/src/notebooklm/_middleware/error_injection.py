"""ErrorInjectionMiddleware — synthetic-error short-circuit for the chain.

Per ADR-0009 §"Chain ordering", ``ErrorInjectionMiddleware`` sits just *inside*
``RetryMiddleware`` / ``AuthRefreshMiddleware`` and just *outside*
``TracingMiddleware``. The chain is
``[Drain, Metrics, Semaphore, Retry, AuthRefresh, ErrorInjection, Tracing]``.

Test-only path. Production behavior is unchanged when no builder is wired
into the middleware — the constructor's default ``builder=None`` makes
``__call__`` a pass-through even if ``NOTEBOOKLM_VCR_RECORD_ERRORS`` is set.
Production code paths (``MiddlewareChainBuilder`` in ``_middleware/chain.py``)
construct ``ErrorInjectionMiddleware()`` with no builder, so the substitution
path can never fire from a production install. Tests that want the
substitution to fire construct the middleware directly with an explicit
``builder=`` argument (issue #1005 — replaces the previous filesystem-walking
``_load_builder()`` that called ``importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`` on
``tests/cassette_patterns.py`` at runtime, which broke wheel installs and
exposed an arbitrary-code-exec path keyed off the env var).

When a builder IS wired AND the env var resolves to ``"429"`` / ``"5xx"`` /
``"expired_csrf"`` (via :func:`_error_injection._get_error_injection_mode`),
every chain invocation short-circuits with a synthetic :class:`httpx.Response`
built by the injected callable (canonical implementation:
``tests/cassette_patterns.build_synthetic_error_response``) — the chain leaf
(``RuntimeTransport.terminal``) is NOT called. The same env-var startup guard
(:func:`_error_injection._refuse_synthetic_error_outside_test_context`)
still fires at client construction (``NotebookLMClient.__init__``) so a leaked
deploy env never reaches production wiring; the builder-not-wired default is the
second line of defense closing the issue-#1005 attack surface.

This middleware is the only production substitution surface for synthetic
errors.

Behavior contract:

- ``builder`` is ``None`` (production default) → ``await next_call(request)``
  unchanged (pass-through), regardless of env var.
- Env var unset → ``await next_call(request)`` unchanged (pass-through),
  regardless of builder.
- Env var set, builder wired, mode ``"429"`` → raise
  :class:`TransportRateLimited` so the OUTER ``RetryMiddleware`` retries
  (restoring ADR-0009 §"ErrorInjection inside Retry — synthetic transient
  failures trigger retry"). The raised
  exception carries the synthetic ``Retry-After`` header so the retry
  honors the rate-limit timing.
- Env var set, builder wired, mode ``"5xx"`` → raise
  :class:`TransportServerError` so ``RetryMiddleware`` retries with
  exponential backoff.
- Env var set, builder wired, mode ``"expired_csrf"`` (HTTP 400) → raise
  the raw :class:`httpx.HTTPStatusError` so ``AuthRefreshMiddleware``
  (outside this middleware in the chain ordering) catches it via
  ``is_auth_error`` and drives the refresh-then-retry flow.

All raised exceptions wrap a synthetic :class:`httpx.Response` anchored to
``request.url`` / ``request.headers`` / ``request.body`` so callers
inspecting ``response.request`` see what the leaf would have sent.

Retry semantics: ``RetryMiddleware`` sits OUTSIDE this middleware, and this
middleware raises the proper transport exceptions for 429/5xx so the outer
retry fires. Each retry re-enters this middleware, which re-raises — so every
retry re-fires the synthetic error.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract and
``src/notebooklm/_error_injection.py`` for the env-var / startup-guard
helpers.

    Holds no shared state. The synthetic-response builder is injected by
    the caller (default ``None``); production wiring in
    :class:`notebooklm._middleware.chain.MiddlewareChainBuilder` never
    passes a builder, so the substitution path stays inaccessible from
