"""Middleware-chain host.

The :class:`MiddlewareChainHost` owns the four pieces of state that the
wired middleware chain reads on every authed POST plus the chain leaf
itself:

* the three retry-budget tunables (``_rate_limit_max_retries`` /
  ``_server_error_max_retries`` / ``_refresh_retry_delay``) that the
  chain's provider lambdas dereference live (``getattr(host, …)``);
* the installed chain reference (``_authed_post_chain``) that the
  transport's ``chain_provider`` closure dereferences on every authed
  POST so post-construction reassignment continues to steer the live
  chain;
* the chain leaf coroutine (``_authed_post_chain_terminal``) that
  forwards to :meth:`RuntimeTransport.terminal`;
* the dynamic refresh delegate (``await_refresh``) reached by the
  middleware chain (``wire_middleware_chain`` captures
  ``chain_host.await_refresh`` directly).

This module is intentionally narrow:

* It does NOT know about metrics, the kernel, the http client, the
  RPC semaphore, or the auth snapshot. Those live in the collaborator
  bundle and in explicit provider lambdas wired by the composition root.
* The host has no back-reference to :class:`NotebookLMClient` — the client
  reaches it through ``self._composed.chain_host``, but not the other way
  around. This avoids a client ↔ transport cycle, per ADR-0014 Rule 4.

The transport / wire helpers take the host directly via the
``chain_host`` parameter; the chain reads ``chain_host._<attr>`` on
every attempt. Tests that need a mid-flight mutation rebind on the
host (``core._composed.chain_host._<attr> = ...``); there are no client-side
forwards in front of the host.

    Constructed by :func:`compose_client_internals` BEFORE
    :class:`NotebookLMClient`. The transport is bound write-once via
    :meth:`_bind_transport` after :func:`build_runtime_transport`
    returns — this resolves the host ↔ transport construction cycle
    without giving either side a permanent back-reference to the other.

    Attributes:
        _auth_refresh: The :class:`AuthRefreshCoordinator` collaborator.
            :meth:`await_refresh` looks up the coordinator dynamically
            on every call so a fixture-time rebind of
            ``host._auth_refresh.await_refresh = fake`` keeps steering
            the live refresh-and-retry path.
        _rate_limit_max_retries: Budget consumed by the retry middleware
            on 429 responses. Stored on the host (the chain's provider
            lambda reads this attribute live, so mid-flight rebinding
            takes effect on the next attempt).
        _server_error_max_retries: Budget consumed by the retry
            middleware on 5xx responses. Same live-read contract.
        _refresh_retry_delay: Backoff between refresh-retry attempts
            in the auth-refresh middleware. Same live-read contract.
        _authed_post_chain: The wired middleware chain. ``None`` until
            :func:`compose_client_internals` assigns it directly here.
            The transport's ``chain_provider`` lambda reads this
            attribute every authed POST.
        _transport: The :class:`RuntimeTransport` collaborator. ``None``
            until :meth:`_bind_transport` fires; after that bind the
            chain leaf (:meth:`_authed_post_chain_terminal`) can forward
            to ``transport.terminal``.
