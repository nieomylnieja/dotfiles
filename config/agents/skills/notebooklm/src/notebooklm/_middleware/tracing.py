"""TracingMiddleware — innermost middleware in the chain.

Per ADR-0009 §"Chain ordering", ``TracingMiddleware`` is
the **innermost** wrapper around the ``Kernel.post`` transport leaf. It logs one
"starting" record before invoking ``next_call`` and one "completed"
(success) or "failed" (exception) record after, capturing per-attempt
HTTP-level visibility — including retry attempts, which is why it sits
inside ``RetryMiddleware``.

Pure observer: the middleware never mutates ``request`` or transforms
``response``. The frozen ``RpcRequest`` dataclass enforces request
immutability at the type level; the response is forwarded unchanged
(same :class:`RpcResponse` instance) so any middleware above the leaf
sees exactly what the leaf returned.

Trace record fields (emitted via ``logger.<level>(..., extra={...})`` so
structured-logging consumers see them as ``LogRecord`` attributes):

- ``rpc_method`` — value of ``RPC_CONTEXT_RPC_METHOD``, supplied via the
  ``rpc_method`` kwarg passed by ``RpcExecutor._execute_once``. ``None`` only
  for the chat streaming path (``_chat.transport.chat_aware_authed_post`` — chat-side
  requests are not classified RPCs) and for ``__new__``-built fixtures
  driving the chain directly.
- ``log_label`` — value of ``RPC_CONTEXT_LOG_LABEL``. The middleware chain
  always populates this key (it is one of the three transport-call kwargs).
  May be ``None`` only for a ``__new__``-built fixture exercising a malformed
  request.
- ``status_code`` — ``response.response.status_code`` on the success
  record (omitted from "starting" and "failed" records).
- ``duration_ms`` — wall-clock duration of the ``next_call`` invocation
  in milliseconds (via :func:`time.perf_counter`). Omitted from the
  "starting" record; included on success and failure.
- ``exception_type`` — only on the "failed" record; the qualified name of
  the exception class that propagated out of ``next_call``.

Failure mode: if ``next_call`` raises, emit a "failed" trace record at
``logging.WARNING`` and re-raise the original exception unchanged. The
middleware never swallows.

This is a small class on purpose — the contract is "log before, log
after, never touch the payload." More elaborate tracing (span IDs,
``contextvars`` propagation, OpenTelemetry export) is a future concern;
the structured ``extra=`` fields here give downstream observers enough
hooks to attach.

See ``docs/adr/0009-middleware-chain.md`` for the chain contract.
