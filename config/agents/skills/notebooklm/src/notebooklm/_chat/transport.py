"""Chat-domain consumer-side error-mapping seam over generic transport.

This module owns the chat-flavored exception mapping that wraps a
single authed POST attempt against the NotebookLM batchexecute
endpoint. It is the chat-domain consumer-side seam: transport-layer
exceptions (``TransportAuthExpired``, ``TransportRateLimited``,
``TransportServerError``, raw ``httpx.HTTPStatusError``) raised by
:meth:`RuntimeTransport.perform_authed_post` are translated into
``ChatError`` or ``NetworkError`` so callers (currently only
:class:`ChatAPI.ask`) stay free of HTTP-status branching.

:meth:`ChatAPI.ask` calls :func:`chat_aware_authed_post` directly. Per
ADR-0014 Rule 2 Corollary, this helper takes the :class:`RuntimeTransport`
collaborator directly rather than a local ``ChatRuntime`` Protocol — the
indirection through a chat-local Protocol added no value once
``transport_post`` was its only member.

    Wraps the shared transport pipeline with chat-flavored exception
    mapping: transport-layer auth failures become

    network/rate-limit failures become
    :class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.NetworkError` /
    :class:`~notebooklm.exceptions.ChatError` respectively. This keeps
    ChatAPI free of HTTP-status branching. ``ChatAPI.ask`` calls this
    helper directly.

            ``NotebookLMClient.__init__`` (ADR-0014 Rule 2 Corollary) — no

        build_request: Request builder forwarded to

            messages (e.g. ``"chat.ask"``). Threaded through to the

            value (``parse_label`` is the chat-domain spelling; the chain
            context still names it ``log_label``).

            the shared streaming transport.
