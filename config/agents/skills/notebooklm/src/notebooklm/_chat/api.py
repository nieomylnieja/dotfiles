        Per ADR-0014 Rule 2 Corollary, ``ChatAPI`` depends on the **direct**
        collaborators it exercises (``rpc``, ``transport``, ``reqid``,
        ``loop_guard``) rather than a chat-local Runtime Protocol bundling them.

        Args:
            rpc: RPC dispatch collaborator for the ``get_conversation_*``,
                ``configure``, ``delete_conversation``, and
                ``save_answer_as_note`` round-trips.
            transport: :class:`RuntimeTransport` owning the authed-POST entry
                point used by :meth:`ask` via :func:`chat_aware_authed_post`.
            reqid: :class:`ReqidCounter` minting the per-attempt ``_reqid``
                query parameter for the streamed chat request.
            loop_guard: :class:`LoopGuard` whose :meth:`assert_bound_loop` fires
                before :meth:`ask` acquires the per-conversation lock, so a
                cross-loop follow-up doesn't hang on a lock bound to a dead loop.
            chat_timeout: Per-read HTTP timeout (seconds) for the streamed chat
                endpoint. ``None`` inherits the underlying transport timeout.
            chat_response_max_bytes: Maximum buffered streamed-chat response
                size in bytes. ``None`` inherits the shared RPC response cap.
            conversation_cache: Optional injected cache; defaults to a fresh
                per-instance ``ConversationCache``.
            notebooks: Optional source-id resolver; defaults to a
                ``NotebooksAPI`` around ``rpc`` so a bare ``ChatAPI(...)`` still

        Unlike :meth:`NotesAPI.create`, this preserves the ``[N]``
        citation markers in the answer as interactive hover-anchored
        references in the NotebookLM web UI. It mirrors the wire format
        the web UI's "Save to note" button uses.

        Args:
            notebook_id: The notebook ID.
            ask_result: Result from a prior ``client.chat.ask()`` call.
                Must have non-empty ``references`` — otherwise this
                method raises :class:`ValueError`.
            title: Note title. When ``None`` (default), a title is
                derived from the first 50 characters of the answer
                (``AskResult`` does not currently carry the original
                question, so the answer is used). An empty string
                (``""``) is passed through verbatim — i.e. treated as
                "use this exact (empty) title", NOT as "use default".
                The NotebookLM server may apply smart-title generation
                regardless; the returned ``Note.title`` reflects what
                the server actually stored.

        Returns:
            The created ``Note``. ``Note.content`` holds the answer text
            WITH ``[N]`` markers; the rich citation anchors live
            server-side and surface via the NotebookLM web UI.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``ask_result.references`` is empty. Callers
                without citations should fall back to
                :meth:`NotesAPI.create` for plain-text notes — this
                method raises rather than silently degrading so the
