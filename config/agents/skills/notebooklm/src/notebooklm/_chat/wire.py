    stream ending on a short closing statement). The fallback logs a WARNING

    """Parse citation details from a streamed-chat response structure.

    Absence-vs-malformed policy (#1505 continuity). Citations are *secondary*
    payload riding on a usable answer, so loudness is tiered:

    * **Absence is silent** — an answer with no citations is the common case
      (real traffic routinely sends ``None`` in the ``first[4][3]`` slot):
      no/short type block and falsy citation slots return ``[]`` with zero
      logging, via ``AnswerRow.citations`` (issue #1491).
    * **Container drift RAISES** — a non-list ``first`` (the answer row) or a
      truthy non-list citation container is structural wire drift; it raises
      :class:`UnknownRPCMethodError`, matching this parser's existing raise
      for the ``inner_data[0]`` non-list case and the
      ``unwrap_conversation_turns`` container raise (#1505): a reshaped
      container means the payload can no longer be trusted, so it must not
      silently degrade to "answer without citations".
    * **Per-row malformed WARNS and skips** — a citation entry that is present
      but unusable (wrong shape/type at a slot, no extractable source id, or
      an unexpected error while decoding it) logs at least one bounded
      ``WARNING`` (``reprlib`` previews; a deep malformed source-id tree may
      additionally emit the UUID max-recursion warning), then drops only that
      row; surviving citations are still returned so one bad row never
      destroys a good answer's remaining citations.

    Survivors keep their **raw wire ordinal** as ``citation_number`` (1-based
    position in the citation container), NOT a dense re-count. The answer
    text's literal ``[N]`` markers refer to raw positions, so re-densifying
    after a skip would silently re-anchor ``[N]`` onto a *different* citation
    (e.g. save-as-note anchoring the wrong chunk). A skipped row instead
    leaves a hole: its marker resolves to no reference and downstream
    consumers drop that anchor rather than mis-anchoring. With nothing
    skipped, raw ordinals equal the dense numbering this parser always
    produced. The final assignment in :func:`parse_streaming_chat_response`
    preserves non-``None`` numbers, so the ordinals survive unchanged.

    ``document`` is the answer row's own parsed document, supplying the
    annotation map that stamps each survivor's answer-side range (#2120). The
    stream parser has already built it and passes it in rather than paying for
    a second parse of the same tree; omit it and this function parses the
    document itself.

    The pre-hardening behavior swallowed *every* citation drift at DEBUG and
    returned ``[]`` — a Google reshape degraded to "answers with no
    citations" invisibly.

    Both levels of that fix had to land together. Descending to
    ``cite_inner[4][0]`` while still unwrapping each element's ``[0]`` (the
    pre-#2120 ``PassageRow`` behaviour) makes things strictly *worse* rather
    than better: an element's ``[0]`` is its ``startIndex`` — an ``int``, not a
    nested record — so every element fails the well-formedness check, all are
    skipped, and ``cited_text`` becomes ``None`` for every citation. The
    elements are ``StructuralElement`` rows and are decoded as such, by the
    document adapters shared with the source-content path (#2128).

    ``cited_text`` is what the fragment actually says: its blocks' text
    concatenated, with no separators, no stripping and no filler. It is
    deliberately *not* read back through
    :meth:`~notebooklm.types.StructuredDocument.slice`, which pads undecoded
    positions — the right trade for "what is at these offsets", the wrong one
    for "what did the model quote", where a run of placeholder characters is
    worse than a shorter string.

    **Its length is not a contract, and no string here is a length oracle.**
    It equals ``end_char - start_char`` only for an all-prose, all-BMP
    fragment, and diverges three ways otherwise: it counts Python characters
    where the range counts UTF-16 code units (an astral character costs one);
    it runs short when the fragment spans positions this client does not render
    as text (see :class:`~notebooklm.types.BlockKind`); and it can run long
    because nothing forces a span's text length to match its declared range —
    this repo's own VCR cassettes induce exactly that by scrubbing names to a
    fixed-width placeholder without adjusting the recorded offsets. When the
    width matters, take it from ``end_char - start_char``; ``document.slice()``
    returns exactly that range, but it too counts Python characters, so it is
    ``utf16_len()`` of the slice that equals the range, never ``len()``.
    ``None`` when the fragment decoded no blocks at all (a structural-anchor
    citation).

    ``start_char`` / ``end_char`` span the whole fragment — the union of every
    block's range, independently derived from the same blocks the server's own
    ``cite_inner[3]`` union covers — and are treated as a semantically paired
    range, so a fragment with no usable blocks reports ``(None, None)`` rather
    than a half-populated range the :class:`ChatReference` invariant would
    reject.
