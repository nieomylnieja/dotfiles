    """Parse citation details from a streamed-chat response structure.

    Absence-vs-malformed policy (#1505 continuity). Citations are *secondary*
    payload riding on a usable answer, so loudness is tiered:

    * **Absence is silent** — an answer with no citations is the common case
      (real traffic routinely sends ``None`` in the ``first[4][3]`` slot):
      no/short type block and falsy citation slots return ``[]`` with zero
      logging, via ``AnswerRow.citations`` (issue #1491).
    * **Container drift RAISES** — a non-list ``first`` (the answer row) or a
      truthy non-list citation container is structural wire drift; it raises
      :class:`UnknownRPCMethodError`, matching this parser's existing raise
      for the ``inner_data[0]`` non-list case and the
      ``unwrap_conversation_turns`` container raise (#1505): a reshaped
      container means the payload can no longer be trusted, so it must not
      silently degrade to "answer without citations".
    * **Per-row malformed WARNS and skips** — a citation entry that is present
      but unusable (wrong shape/type at a slot, no extractable source id, or
      an unexpected error while decoding it) logs at least one bounded
      ``WARNING`` (``reprlib`` previews; a deep malformed source-id tree may
      additionally emit the UUID max-recursion warning), then drops only that
      row; surviving citations are still returned so one bad row never
      destroys a good answer's remaining citations.

    Survivors keep their **raw wire ordinal** as ``citation_number`` (1-based
    position in the citation container), NOT a dense re-count. The answer
    text's literal ``[N]`` markers refer to raw positions, so re-densifying
    after a skip would silently re-anchor ``[N]`` onto a *different* citation
    (e.g. save-as-note anchoring the wrong chunk). A skipped row instead
    leaves a hole: its marker resolves to no reference and downstream
    consumers drop that anchor rather than mis-anchoring. With nothing
    skipped, raw ordinals equal the dense numbering this parser always
    produced. The final assignment in :func:`parse_streaming_chat_response`
    preserves non-``None`` numbers, so the ordinals survive unchanged.

    The pre-hardening behavior swallowed *every* citation drift at DEBUG and
    returned ``[]`` — a Google reshape degraded to "answers with no
    citations" invisibly.
