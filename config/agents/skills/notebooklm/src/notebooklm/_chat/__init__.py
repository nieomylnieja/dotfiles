"""Private chat-feature package (facade + helpers unified).

Cohesive cluster promoted from the former flat ``_chat*.py`` modules (issue #1328).
Unlike the other promoted clusters, the ``ChatAPI`` facade (formerly ``_chat.py``) is
moved *into* this package as :mod:`._chat.api` to resolve the package/module name
collision; its public names are re-exported here so existing references such as
``from notebooklm._chat import ChatAPI`` keep resolving unchanged.

No package-init import cycle exists: the dependency direction is strictly one-way
(``api`` imports ``notes``/``wire``/``transport``; none of the helpers
import ``api`` or this package ``__init__``). Importing ``api`` therefore pulls in the
helpers it needs regardless of the order of the aggregating ``from . import ...`` line
below, which ruff's import sorter keeps alphabetised.

# ``notebooklm._chat._extract_next_turn_content`` from the old ``_chat.py`` module;
# unit tests (``tests/unit/test_chat_helpers.py``) import it through this facade.
# It now lives in ``.wire`` (a pure streamed-turn decode helper) but stays
# re-exported here so that import path keeps working across the package promotion.
