"""Atomic JSON write helpers.

Shared by auth storage/account/capture writers and public CLI helpers (via
:mod:`notebooklm.io`) so JSON state writes use the same crash- and
concurrency-safe pattern (NamedTemporaryFile in the same directory,
``chmod 0o600``, ``flush`` + ``fsync`` of the temp file, ``os.replace``, then a
best-effort ``fsync`` of the parent directory).

The write is both **rename-atomic** (a reader sees either the old or the new
file, never a partial one) and, on POSIX, **fsync-durable** (the bytes are
forced to stable storage before the rename), so a power loss / kernel panic
after :func:`atomic_write_json` returns cannot lose the file data. The
parent-directory fsync hardens the directory entry too but is best-effort: it
silently degrades on Windows and on filesystems that reject a directory fsync,
since by then the (fsynced) data has already been committed by the rename.

Default permission mode is ``0o600`` because the primary caller writes
Playwright storage state containing session cookies, which are credential-
equivalent secrets.

For read-modify-write workflows on shared JSON state (``context.json``,
``config.json``), use :func:`atomic_update_json` — it wraps the read, mutate,
and atomic write inside a cross-process file lock (via the ``filelock``
library) so that two concurrent CLI invocations never lose updates.

The sibling ``<path>.lock`` files that :func:`atomic_update_json` creates are
intentionally left on disk after release: ``filelock`` reuses them across
invocations, and unlinking under contention introduces a TOCTOU race where a
second process could create-and-acquire a fresh lock while the first is mid-
delete. They are zero-byte and cheap.

Lock-path derivation contract
-----------------------------

:func:`atomic_update_json` derives its lock as ``<name>.lock`` via
``path.with_suffix(path.suffix + ".lock")`` (e.g. ``config.json`` ->
``config.json.lock``). This pattern is **deliberately distinct** from the
*dotted* ``.<name>.lock`` sentinel that the canonical ``storage_state.json``
mutators serialize on (``_auth.paths._storage_state_lock_path`` ->
``.storage_state.json.lock``; see #1215). Because the two patterns yield two
*different* files, routing a ``storage_state.json`` path through
``atomic_update_json`` would acquire the *wrong* lock and silently re-introduce
the lost-update race that #1215 closed.

To enforce that contract by construction rather than by hand-synced string
literals, :func:`atomic_update_json` rejects ``storage_state.json`` paths up
front (see :data:`_STORAGE_STATE_FILENAME`). The ``config.json`` /
``context.json`` callers keep their existing ``<name>.lock`` files unchanged;
only ``storage_state.json`` is special-cased. Cookie/account writers must use
the dedicated locked writers in :mod:`notebooklm._auth`
(``save_cookies_to_storage`` / ``write_account_metadata`` /
``clear_in_band_account``), which all share ``_storage_state_lock_path``.

    """Atomic + durable JSON write **without** the storage-state path guard.

    Module-private **bypass** imported only by the sealed credential commit
    spine (:mod:`notebooklm._auth.credential_io`). Its two typed wrappers are
    reached by the path-owning profile store and the temporary compatibility
    policy in :mod:`notebooklm._auth.storage`, after those owners take the
    appropriate credential lock. Every other caller must use the public
    :func:`atomic_write_json`, which rejects
    ``storage_state.json`` paths (see that function and :func:`atomic_update_json`
    for the lost-update rationale, #1215). The boundary is enforced by
    ``tests/_guardrails/test_storage_writer_boundary.py`` (an equality-asserted
    allowlist of this private symbol's importer and its two typed callers).

    Steps:

    1. Serialize ``data`` to a sibling :class:`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` in
       the same directory as ``path`` (same-filesystem for ``os.replace``
       atomicity).
    2. ``fchmod`` the temp file to ``mode`` (default ``0o600`` — cookies are
       secrets). Done before the fsync so the permission bits are flushed too.
       Skipped on Windows where POSIX permissions are a no-op and can confuse
       ACLs.
    3. ``flush`` + ``os.fsync`` the temp file so its bytes reach stable storage
       *before* the rename. Without this, the rename can commit while the data
       is still only in the OS page cache, so a crash in the post-replace
       window can leave ``path`` pointing at an inode with no data (truncated /
       zero-length file). A *real* fsync writeback failure (``EIO``, ``ENOSPC``,
       …) aborts the write (temp unlinked, target preserved); only a genuine
       "fsync unsupported" error degrades to a flush-only write.
    4. ``os.replace`` the temp file onto ``path`` (atomic on POSIX and Windows),
       with bounded retries for transient Windows replace races.
    5. Best-effort ``fsync`` of the *parent directory* so the new directory
       entry is itself durable, not just the file data (POSIX only — silently
       skipped on Windows and on filesystems that reject a directory fsync).
    6. On any failure before the replace commits: unlink the temp file and
       re-raise.

    Durability note: steps 3 and 5 make the write *fsync-durable* on POSIX, so
    a power loss / kernel panic after this call returns cannot lose a
    previously-committed ``path``. The parent-directory fsync (step 5) is
    best-effort and never raises — see :func:`_fsync_dir` — because the rename
    has already committed the (fsynced) file data by that point.

    The caller decides whether to log/swallow the exception.

    Corruption recovery semantics:

      *silently* coerced to ``{}`` before the mutator runs. ``context.json``
      and ``config.json`` are always object-shaped, so this defensive
      normalization matches the legacy behavior of the per-caller helpers.
    * Invalid JSON (``json.JSONDecodeError``) is fatal by default — callers
      must opt in to silent recovery by passing ``recover_from_corrupt=True``.
      When opted in, the mutator runs on an empty dict and the write proceeds
      while the lock is still held. Recovery cannot be done outside the lock
      (e.g. unlink-and-retry) without losing a concurrent process's valid
      write — see PR #465 review threads.

    Args:
        path: Target JSON file. Parent directory is created if missing.
        mutator: Pure function ``current -> updated``. Must return a dict.
            Callers may mutate ``current`` in place and return it.
        mode: POSIX permission bits for the written file (default ``0o600``).
        timeout: Seconds to wait for the lock before raising.
        recover_from_corrupt: When True, an unparseable existing file is
