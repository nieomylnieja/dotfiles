# process memory by emitting a huge body. 50 MiB is far above any legitimate
# batchexecute response we've observed and well below the OOM threshold on a

# streaming read loop can read it without creating an import cycle through the

# decoded once, raising ``DecodingError: Error -3 ... incorrect header check``.
# ``content-length`` advertises the compressed size from the wire and no
# longer matches the decoded buffer we hand to the rebuilt Response. Compared
# against ``key.lower()`` so case variants from the wire all match.

    bytes are then attached to a fresh :class:`httpx.Response` with the same
    status code, headers, and request, so downstream callers can keep using
    ``response.text`` / ``response.content`` exactly as they did when this was a
    plain ``client.post`` call.

    invoked while still inside the streaming context so chain middlewares and
    the terminal error mapper see the same :class:`httpx.HTTPStatusError`, with

    chunk, so reading them does not require consuming the stream).
