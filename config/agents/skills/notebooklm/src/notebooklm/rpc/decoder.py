        Malformed chunks are skipped with a warning logged. A byte-count line

        logged at DEBUG and tolerated when the following payload is still

        preserve Google's original byte count and live Google responses use a
        different unit (likely UTF-16 code units) than ``len(s.encode("utf-8"))``.
        Because a mismatch is the *expected* case on healthy live streams, it is
        deliberately NOT a WARNING: it only increments the process-wide
        ``byte_count_mismatch_total`` counter, which is the honest drift signal

        mismatches). A JSONDecodeError on the payload still emits a WARNING on the
        subsequent parse-failure path. If the malformed-payload rate exceeds
        10%, raises RPCError as this likely indicates API changes. Framing and
        mixed payload/framing corruption keep their own strict guards without
        letting byte-count records dilute the payload-specific threshold.
