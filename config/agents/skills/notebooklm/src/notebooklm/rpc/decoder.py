#: RPCs observed answering a null result with a non-OK ``google.rpc.Status`` on
#: a flow this client currently treats as SUCCESSFUL. A sweep of all 141

#: The fifth is chat_ask_oversized_rejection.yaml's ``[3]`` (#1472). It carries
#: no rpc id at all because streamed chat is not a ``batchexecute`` RPC, so it
#: never passes through ``decode_response`` — it is handled by ``_chat/wire.py``
#: and is not part of this list.
#:
#: Recorded here as a *finding*, not a blessing: only the first has ever been
#: reasoned about (a cosmetic no-op), and whether the two share rejections are
#: benign or a silently-dropped refusal is an open question this change does not

    Note:
        Malformed chunks are skipped with a warning logged. A byte-count line
        without a following payload is malformed. A byte-count mismatch is
        logged at DEBUG and tolerated when the following payload is still

        preserve Google's original byte count and live Google responses use a
        different unit (likely UTF-16 code units) than ``len(s.encode("utf-8"))``.
        Because a mismatch is the *expected* case on healthy live streams, it is
        deliberately NOT a WARNING: it only increments the process-wide
        ``byte_count_mismatch_total`` counter, which is the honest drift signal

        mismatches). A JSONDecodeError on the payload still emits a WARNING on the
        subsequent parse-failure path. If the malformed-payload rate exceeds
        10%, raises RPCError as this likely indicates API changes. Framing and
        mixed payload/framing corruption keep their own strict guards without
        letting byte-count records dilute the payload-specific threshold.

    whatever the array's length: the bare ``[code]`` form issues #114 / #294
    observed, and the longer ``[code, message, details]` form the proto allows.
    Only the leading value is inspected, and only when it is an ``int`` in the
    gRPC canonical range; anything else returns ``None``.

    The arity restriction this used to carry (``len(error_info) != 1``) made
    every longer status invisible — including the ``message`` slot #2188 is
    about, which can only ever appear in a longer array. The
    ``[8, None, [[UserDisplayableError, ...]]]`` rate-limit shape still raises
    on the ``UserDisplayableError`` path *before* this helper is consulted; when
    that path does not fire (e.g. the marker scan hit its depth cap), reporting
    the leading status is strictly better than the unqualified
    "empty result" fallback.

    Note: we do not claim these codes are unambiguously gRPC — REMOVE_RECENTLY_VIEWED
    returns ``[13]`` on what the client treats as a successful no-op (see
    tests/cassettes/notebooks_remove_from_recent.yaml). Callers must respect
    ``allow_null`` semantics before treating the code as an error.
