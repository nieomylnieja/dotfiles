"""Shared exponential-backoff helper for retry loops.

``compute_backoff_delay`` is shared by transport and polling retry loops;
artifact rate-limit retry uses the public
:func:`notebooklm.artifacts.calculate_backoff_delay` helper. The function is
pure math (sync, no I/O) — callers pair it with their own sleep primitive.

Jitter uses an ``rng`` parameter so tests can pass a seeded ``random.Random``
for deterministic output. In production callers pass ``rng=None`` and the
module's shared ``random`` is used. Setting ``jitter_ratio=0`` short-circuits
the rng call entirely, which both keeps no-jitter call sites bit-exact and
lets them avoid any randomness dependency.

    so the result is always within ``raw * (1 ± jitter_ratio)``.

    ``attempt`` is 0-indexed: ``attempt=0`` yields ``base`` (± jitter),
    ``attempt=1`` yields ``2 * base``, and so on. Negative ``attempt`` is
    treated as 0.

    ``jitter_ratio=0`` produces a deterministic ``raw`` value and skips
    the rng call entirely, so call sites that want bit-exact powers-of-two
    (e.g. existing test schedules) can opt out of randomness cleanly.

    ``rng=None`` falls back to the module's shared ``random`` source.
    Tests should pass ``rng=random.Random(seed)`` for reproducibility.
