# SURFACE axis (#1726, headless-browser + real web captures, 2026-07-01): each studio
# Customize dialog SENDS a specific mode for its format's prompt suggestions.

# card (decoding the exact otmP3b mode), plus real Video web captures:
#   1 Audio·DeepDive   2 Audio·Brief   5 Audio·Critique   6 Audio·Debate
#   3 Video·Explainer  10 Video·Short   4 Chat/ask   8 Quiz   9 Flashcards
#   7 -> unidentified (no UI surface sends it).
#
# OUTPUT axis (#1612, live A/B 2026-06-20, fixed notebook+query, only ``mode`` varies):
# what the backend RETURNS for each mode. ``5`` critique / ``6`` debate scaffolding /
# ``8`` quiz / ``9`` flashcards are format-distinctive in the returned text; ``1, 2,
# 3, 7, 10`` return content-direction prompts (persona / format / topic) that read
# ~like the ``4`` default. That is CONSISTENT with the surface axis: for deep-dive /
# brief / explainer / short, NotebookLM steers the format via content direction (not
# format jargon), so their suggestion text is general by design. So the labels name
# the SURFACE (which format's dialog sends the mode), not a promise about output tone.
