"""Request-id counter helper for the NotebookLM client runtime.

Owns the monotonic ``_reqid`` value that Google's chat backend requires per
request, plus the lazily-allocated ``asyncio.Lock`` that serialises the
read-modify-write under concurrent ``ChatAPI.ask`` callers. The reqid
surface has one home (this file) instead of being woven into the runtime
composition root alongside metrics, drain, and auth state.

Design constraints (load-bearing — see ``tests/unit/test_reqid_counter.py`` and
``tests/unit/test_session_reqid_concurrent.py``):

* ``__init__`` MUST be event-loop-agnostic — it must NOT instantiate
  ``asyncio.Lock()`` eagerly. ``NotebookLMClient`` is routinely built outside a
  running loop (sync-mode ``NotebookLMClient(...)`` before the caller's
  ``asyncio.run``), and ``asyncio.Lock()`` binds to the running loop on
  construction in some Python versions. The lock is therefore allocated
  lazily inside :meth:`next_reqid`, which is always called from an async
  context.

* Baseline ``_value`` is ``100000`` and the default ``step`` is ``100000``.
  Both are part of the chat-API contract (the per-request ``_reqid`` URL
  parameter must be a large positive integer); do NOT change them.

* :meth:`next_reqid` rejects ``bool`` and non-positive ``step`` explicitly so
  ``next_reqid(step=True)`` cannot silently degrade to ``step=1`` (``bool``
  is a subclass of ``int`` in Python) and ``step=0`` / ``step<0`` cannot
  break the chat-side uniqueness / monotonicity guarantees.

* Optional ``on_lock_wait`` callback receives the seconds spent blocked on
  :attr:`_lock`. Decouples the counter from
  :class:`notebooklm._client_metrics.ClientMetrics` so this class is unit-
  testable in isolation; the runtime-init helper wires it up to
  ``ClientMetrics.record_lock_wait`` at construction (see
  ``_runtime.init.build_collaborators``).
